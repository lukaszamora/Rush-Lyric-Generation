Finding My Way.
Yeah, oh yeah! Left me lonely each night.
Ooh, said I, I'm comin' out to get you While I sing my sad song.
Ooh, sit down, I'm comin' out to find you.
Ooh, yeah Look out! I'm comin', whoa, whoa.
Ooh yeah Look out! I'm comin', whoa, yeah.
Findin' my way!.
I'm runnin', findin' my way back home.
I've been gone so long.
I've lost count of the years I'm comin'.
Well, I sang some sad songs Ooh, babe, I said I'm runnin'.
Oh yes, and cried some bad tears Whoa, babe, I said I'm comin' to get you, mama.
Said I'm runnin'.

Ooh, yeah Ooh, yeah.
Ooh, yeah Ooh, yeah.
Findin' my way!.
Findin' my way!.
You've done me no right.
But you've done me some wrong.
Need Some Love.
I'm runnin' here, I'm runnin' there.
I'm lookin' for a girl.
'Cause there's nothin' I need, there's nothin' I want more.
In the whole wide world.
Well, I need it quick and I need it now.
Before I start to fade away.
That's why I'm searchin', that's why I'm lookin'.
Each and ev'ry day.
Ooh, I need some love.
I said I need some love.
Ooh yes, I need some love.
This feelin' I can't rise above.
Ooh, yeah, yeah.
Well, I been hustlin' here, I been hustlin' there.
I been searchin' for about a week.
And I started feelin' this strange sensation.
My knees are startin' gettin' weak.
Well, I need what keeps a young man alive.
I'm sayin' I need it now.
I'm gonna get the message across to you.
Some way, some how.
Take A Friend.
Well, I'm lookin' at you.
And I'm wond'rin' what you're gonna do.
Looks like you got no friends.
No one to stick with you till the end.
Take yourself a friend.
Keep 'em till the end.
Whether woman or man.
It makes you feel so good....
So good.
Yes, you think you're all right.
But now you're lonely ev'ry night.
Well, you need a friend.
Someone on whom you can always depend.
Yes, you need some advice.
Well, let me put it to you nice.
I said you need a friend.
Someone who'll stick with you to the end.
Here Again.
I said I played this song so many times before.
That the melody keeps repeating.
Growing new ideas, flowing chords and notes.
Like a mountain river bleeding.
Well, I say as I look back at all the thoughts I've had.
They reflect just what I'm learning.
Yes, you know that the hardest part, yes, I say it is to stay on top.
On top of a world forever churning.
Well, you say you can laugh, but I can see that your eyes are glass.
Well, do you see, can't you see, what I'm feeling?.
Yes, I've seen your face before.
Why, I've seen it everywhere.
Showing up to me without a scent revealing.
Well, I said will it ever change?.
Will it stay the same?.
I'd surely like to know before it's over.
Well, I said I played some.
I said it won't be long.
Won't be long before I stop and play it over.
You know I've, I've seen your face before.
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?.
Oh, oh, I've, I've been in one place too long.
Is it ever gonna, ever gonna change again?.
What You're Doing.
Well, I see you standin' there.
With your finger in the air.
Everything we do, you wanna leave it up to you.
Who do you think you are?.
You think you are a star?.
Tryin' to run the town.
Always tryin' to put us down.
Well, you think that you're right.
You think you're out of sight.
Tell me something, mister.
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?.
Well, you say you've been tryin'.
You know that you're lyin'.
I think you need some groovin'.
Who do you think you're foolin', now?.
Well, you better start changin'.
Your life needs rearrangin'.
You better do some talkin'.
Or you better do some walkin' now.
Yeah, you think that you're right.
You think you're out of sight.
Tell me something, mister.
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?.
I know what you're doing.
All that you been doin' wrong.
I don't know what you're feelin'.
Oh, but you been feelin' long.
Well, you think that you're right.
Tell me something, mister.
Why'd you have to make us so uptight?.
In The Mood.
Hey, now, baby.
Well, I like your smile.
Won't you come and talk to me.
For a little while?.
Well, you're makin' me crazy.
The way you roll them eyes.
Won't you come and sit with me?.
I'll tell you all my lies.
Hey, baby, it's a quarter to eight.
I feel I'm in the mood.
Hey baby, the hour is late.
I feel I've got to move.
Well, hey, now, baby.
Don't you talk so fast.
I'm just tryin' to make these good times.
I'm tryin' to make it last.
Everything's getting hazy.
Now honey, where'd you go?.
I just want to find out, baby....
Where'd you learn what you know?.
Well, hey, now, baby.
I said I like your style.
You really got me, baby.
Way down deep inside.
Ooh, you drive me crazy.
Baby, you're the one.
I just want to rock and roll you woman.
Until the night is gone.
Before and After.
Love won't see me comin'.
On a Sunday noon today I keep tryin' to get through to you baby.
Still don't believe we're fadin' All you do is stare.
But now the world should wait.
I don't wanna see that.
And now you're finally listenin' I need you by my side.
To what I have to say Well, I don't want to be your lover.
Well, the time is right Babe, I wanna be your man.
And it is today.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, now my story's over, baby.
Maybe we could talk about it And I ain't gonna tell it twice.
And try to get it straight Well, you better start listenin'.
After all these years, baby Or get out of my life.
Maybe it's too late.
Or you're gonna be left out.
But I really need to I said left out in the cold.
Have you by my side Yeah, before you get my lovin'.
And that's the only feelin' Babe, you'll be too old.
Baby, I can't hide.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well you aren't listenin' Well, I'm talkin' to you baby.
I ain't talkin' Well, I said yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We ain't gettin' nowhere.
Working Man.
I get up at seven, yeah.
And I go to work at nine.
I got no time for livin'.
Yes, I'm workin' all the time.
It seems to me.
I could live my life.
A lot better than I think I am.
I guess that's why they call me.
They call me the working man.
They call me the working man.
I guess that's what I am.
I get home at five o'clock.
And I take myself out a nice, cold beer.
Always seem to be wonderin'.
Why there's nothin' goin' down here.
Well, they call me the working man.
I guess that's what I am.
Know your place in life is where you want to be.
Don't let them tell you that you owe it all to me.
Keep on looking forward; no use in looking 'round.
Hold your head above the ground and they won't bring you down.
Anthem of the heart and anthem of the mind.
A funeral dirge for eyes gone blind.
We marvel after those who sought.
New wonders in the world, wonders in the world,.
Wonders in the world they wrought..
Live for yourself -- there's no one else.
More worth living for.
Begging hands and bleeding hearts will.
Only cry out for more.
Well, I know they've always told you.
Selfishness was wrong.
Yet it was for me, not you, I.
Came to write this song.
Best I Can.
I've got a livin' that's rough, a future that's tough.
You know what I mean.
Blankers and boasters, all the bluffers and posers.
I'm not into that scene.
You can tell me that I got no class.
Look around, you'll see who's laughin' last.
Don't give me speeches 'cause they're oh so droll.
Leave me alone, let me rock and roll.
Got an itchin' to rock, a hate for small talk.
I'm funny that way.
Got my sights on the stars, won't get that far.
But I'll try anyway.
I just like to please, don't like to tease.
I'm easy like that.
Don't like long rests, I must confess.
I'm an impatient cat.
I do the best that I can.
I'm just what I am.
I do the best I can.
Well, I know what I am.
Rock and roll-in's a scream, makin' millions my dream.
Well, I do that a lot.
I'll just give it a try, won't let good times pass me by.
They're all I've got.
Beneath, Between And Behind.
Ten score years ago, defeat the kingly foe.
A wondrous dream came into being.
Tame the trackless waste, no virgin land left chaste.
All shining eyes, but never seeing.
Beneath the noble bird.
Between the proudest words.
Behind the beauty, cracks appear.
Once, with heads held high.
They sang out to the sky.
Why do their shadows bow in fear?.
Watch the cities rise.
Another ship arrives.
Earth's melting pot and ever growing.
Fantastic dreams come true.
Inventing something new.
The greatest minds, and never knowing....
The guns replace the plow, facades are tarnished now.
The principles have been betrayed.
The dreams's gone stale, but still, let hope prevail.
History's debt won't be repaid.
By-Tor And The Snow Dog.
At The Tobes Of Hades.
The Tobes of Hades, lit by flickering torchlight.
The netherworld is gathered in the glare.
Prince By-Tor takes the cavern to the north light.
The sign of Eth is rising in the air..
By-Tor, knight of darkness,.
Centurion of evil, devil's prince..
Across The Styx.
Across the River Styx, out of the lamplight.
His nemesis is waiting at the gate.
The Snow Dog, ermine glowing in the damp night.
Coal-black eyes shimmering with hate..
By-Tor and the Snow Dog.
Square for battle, let the fray begin....
The Battle.
Epilogue.
The battle's over and the dust is clearing.
Disciples of the Snow Dog sound the knell.
Rejoicing echoes as the dawn is nearing.
By-Tor in defeat retreats to Hell.
Snow Dog is victorious.
The land of the Overworld is saved again..
Fly By Night.
Airport scurry flurry faces.
Parade of passers by.
People going many places.
With a smile or just a sigh.
Waiting waiting pass the time.
Another cigarette.
Get in line - gate thirty-nine.
The time is not here yet.
Why try? I know why.
The feeling inside me says it's time I was gone.
Clear head, new life ahead.
I want to be king now not just one more pawn.
Fly by night, away from here.
Change my life again.
Fly by night goodbye my dear.
My ship isn't coming and I just can't pretend.
Moon rise, thoughtful eyes.
Staring back at me from the window beside.
No fright or hindsight.
Leaving behind that empty feeling inside.
Start a new chapter.
Find what I'm after.
It's changing every day.
The change of a season.
Is enough of a reason.
To want to get away.
Quiet and pensive.
My thoughts apprehensive.
The hours drift away.
Leaving my homeland.
Playing a lone hand.
My life begins today.
Making Memories.
There's a time for feelin' as good as we can.
The time is now, and there's no stoppin' us.
There's a time for livin' as high as we can.
Behind us you will only see our dust..
You know we're havin' good days.
And we hope they're gonna last.
Our future still looks brighter than our past.
We feel no need to worry.
No reason to be sad.
Our mem'ries remind us, maybe road life's not so bad..
Just keep smilin', move onward ev'ry day.
And try to keep our thoughts away from home.
We're trav'lin' around, no time to settle down.
And satisfy our wanderlust to roam..
Well from sea to shining sea, and a hundred points between.
Still we go on diggin' ev'ry show.
The cities in the land all extend a welcome hand.
Till morning when it's time for us to go..
Rivendell.
Sunlight dances through the leaves.
Soft winds stir the sighing trees.
Lying in the warm grass.
Feel the sun upon your face.
Elfin songs and endless nights.
Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights.
Time will never touch you.
Here in this enchanted place.
I've traveled now for many miles.
It feels so good to see the smiles of.
Friends who never left your mind.
When you were far away.
From the golden light of coming dawn.
Till the twilight where the sun is gone.
We treasure ev'ry season.
And ev'ry passing day.
You feel there's something calling you.
You're wanting to return.
To where the misty mountains rise and friendly fires burn.
A place you can escape the world.
Where the dark lord cannot go.
Peace of mind and sanctuary by loud water's flow.
We feel the coming of a new day.
Darkness gives way to light a new way.
Stop here for a while until the world,.
The world calls you away.
Yet you know I've had the feeling.
Standing with my senses reeling.
This is the place to grow old till.
I reach my final day..
In The End.
Well, I can see what you mean.
It just takes me longer.
And I can feel what you feel.
It just makes you stronger.
I know, I know, I know.
Oh, the feeling grows.
I see, I see, I see.
It's got to be.
You can take me for a little while.
You can take me, you can make me smile in the end.
Well, I can do what you do.
You just do it better.
And I can cry like you cry.
It just makes me sadder.
Well, I can shine like you shine.
It doesn't make me brighter.
But if I think like you think.
It don't make my load much lighter.
Bastille Day.
There's no bread, let them eat cake.
There's no end to what they'll take.
Flaunt the fruits of noble birth.
Wash the salt into the earth.
But they're marching to Bastille Day.
La guillotine will claim her bloody prize.
Free the dungeons of the innocent.
The king will kneel, and let his kingdom rise.
Bloodstained velvet, dirty lace.
Naked fear on every face.
See them bow their heads to die.
As we would bow as they rode by.
And we're marching to Bastille Day.
La guillotine will claim her bloody prize.
Sing, o choirs of cacophony.
The king has kneeled, to let his kingdom rise..
Lessons taught but never learned.
All around us anger burns.
Guide the future by the past.
Long ago the mould was cast.
For they marched up to Bastille Day.
La guillotine - claimed her bloody prize.
Hear the echoes of the centuries.
Power isn't all that money buys.
I Think I'm Going Bald.
I looked in the mirror today.
My eyes just didn't seem so bright.
I've lost a few more hairs.
I think I'm going bald.
I think I'm going bald.
Seems like only yesterday.
We would sit and talk of dreams all night.
Dreams of youth.
And simple truths.
Now we're so involved.
So involved with life.
Walk down vanity fair.
Memory lane everywhere.
Wall Street shuffles there.
Dressed in flowing hair.
Once we loved the flowers.
Now we ask the price of the land.
Once we would take water.
But now it must be wine.
Now we've been.
And now we've seen.
What price peace of mind.
Take a piece of my mind.
My life is slipping away.
I'm aging every day.
But even when I'm grey.
I'll still be grey my way.
Lakeside Park.
Midway hawkers calling.
Try your luck with me.
Merry-go-round wheezing.
The same old melody.
A thousand ten cent wonders.
Who could ask for more.
A pocketful of silver.
The key to heaven's door.
Lakeside Park.
Willows in the breeze.
Lakeside Park.
So many memories.
Laughing rides.
Midway lights.
Shining stars on summer nights.
Days of barefoot freedom.
Racing with the waves.
Nights of starlit secrets.
Crackling driftwood flames.
Drinking by the lighthouse.
Smoking on the pier.
Still we saw the magic.
Fading every year.
Everyone would gather.
On the twenty fourth of May.
Sitting in the sand.
To watch the fireworks display.
Dancing fires on the beach.
Singing songs together.
Though it's just a memory.
Some memories last forever.
The Necromancer.
Into Darkness.
As grey traces of dawn tinge the eastern sky, the three travelers, men of Willow Dale, emerge from the forest.
shadow. Fording the River Dawn, they turn south, journeying into the dark and forbidding lands of the.
Necromancer. Even now the intensity of his dread power can be felt, weakening the body and saddening the.
heart. Ultimately they will become empty, mindless spectres, stripped of will and soul. Only their thirst for.
freedom gives them hunger for vengeance....
Silence shrouds the forest.
As the birds announce the dawn.
Three trav'llers ford the river.
And southward journey on.
The road is lined with peril.
The air is charged with fear.
The shadow of his nearness.
Weighs like iron tears.
Under the Shadow.
Shreds of black cloud loom in overcast skies. The Necromancer keeps watch with his magic prism eyes. He views.
all his lands and is already aware of the three helpless invaders trapped in his lair....
Brooding in the tower.
Watching o'er his land.
Holding ev'ry creature.
Helplessly they stand.
Gaze into his prisms.
Knowing they are near.
Lead them to the dungeons.
Spectres numb with fear.
They bow defeated.
Return of the Prince.
Enter the Champion. Prince By-Tor appears to battle for freedom from chains of long years. The spell has been.
broken...the Dark Lands are bright, the Wraith of the Necromancer soars away...in the night..
Stealthily attacking.
By-Tor slays his foe.
The men are free to run now.
From labyrinths below.
The Wraith of Necromancer.
Shadows through the sky.
Another land to darken.
With evil prism eye....
Terminat hora diem; terminat auctor opus.
The Fountain of Lamneth.
In the Valley Crying back to consciousness.
I am born The coldness grips my skin.
I am me The sky is pitching violently.
I am new Drawn by shrieking winds.
I am free Seaspray blurs my vision.
Look at me Waves roll by so fast.
I am young Save my ship of freedom.
Sight unseen I'm lashed helpless to the mast.
Life unsung.
Call out for direction.
My eyes have just been opened And there's no one there to steer.
And they're open very wide Shout out for salvation.
Images around me But there's no one there to hear.
Don't identify inside Cry out supplication.
Just one blur I recognize For the maelstrom is near.
The one that soothes and feeds Scream out desperation.
My way of life is easy But no one cares to hear.
And as simple are my needs.
Remembering when first I held.
Yet my eyes are drawn toward The wheel in my own hands.
The mountain in the east I took the helm so eagerly.
Fascinates and captivates And sailed for distant lands.
Gives my heart no peace But now the sea's too heavy.
The mountain holds the sunrise And I just don't understand.
In the prison of the night Why must my crew desert me.
Till bursting forth from rocky chains When I need a guiding hand.
The valley floods with light.
Panacea.
Living one long sunrise The whiteness of confusion.
For to me all things are new Is unfolding from my mind.
I've never watched the sky grow pale I stare around in wonder.
Or strolled through fields of dew Have I left my life behind.
I do not know of dust to dust.
I live from breath to breath I catch the scent of ambergris.
I live to climb that mountain to And turn my head... surprised.
The Fountain of Lamneth My gaze is caught and held.
And I am helpless, mesmerized.
Didacts and Narpets.
Stay! Go! Panacea - liquid grace.
Work! No! Oh let me touch your fragile face.
Learn! Live! Enchantment falls around me.
Earn! Give! And I know I cannot leave.
Stay or fight? What's right?.
Listen! Here's a meaning for my life.
A shelter from the storm.
Pacify my troubles with.
No One At the Bridge Her body, soft and warm.
Naked in our unity Look... the mist is rising.
A smile for every tear And the sun is peaking through.
Gentle hands that promise me See, the steps grow lighter.
Comfort through the years As I reach their final few.
Yet I know I must be gone Hear, the dancing waters.
Before the light of dawn I must be drawing near.
Feel, my heart is pounding.
Panacea - passion pure With embattled hope and fear.
I can't resist your gentle lure.
My heart will lie beside you Now, at last I fall before.
And my wandering body grieves The Fountain of Lamneth.
I thought I would be singing.
Bacchus Plateau But I'm tired... out of breath.
Another endless day Many journeys end here.
Silhouettes of grey But, the secret's told the same.
Another glass of wine Life is just a candle.
Drink with eyes that shine And a dream must give it flame.
To days without that chill at morning.
Long nights time out of mind The key, the end, the answer.
Stripped of their disguise.
Draw another goblet Still it's all confusion.
From the cask of '43 And tears spring to my eyes.
Crimson misty memory Though I've reached a signpost.
Hazy glimpse of me It's really not the end.
Give me back my wonder Like Old Sol behind the mountain.
I've something more to give I'll be coming up again....
I guess it doesn't matter.
There's not much more to live I'm in motion.
I am still.
Another foggy dawn I am crying.
The mountain almost gone I am still.
Another doubtful fear I'm together.
The road is not so clear I'm apart.
My soul grows ever weary I'm forever.
And the end is ever near At the start.
The Fountain Still... I am.

A Passage to Bangkok.
Our first stop is in Bogota.
To check Colombian fields.
The natives smile and pass along.
A sample of their yield.
Sweet Jamaican pipe dreams.
Golden Acapulco nights.
Then Morocco, and the East,.
Fly by morning light.
We're on the train to Bangkok.
Aboard the Thailand Express.
We'll hit the stops along the way.
We only stop for the best.
Wreathed in smoke in Lebanon.
We burn the midnight oil.
The fragrance of Afghanistan.
Rewards a long day's toil.
Pulling into Katmandu.
Smoke rings fill the air.
Perfumed by a Nepal night.
The Express gets you there.
The Twilight Zone.
A pleasant faced man steps up to greet you.
He smiles and says he's pleased to meet you.
Beneath his hat the strangeness lies.
Take it off, he's got three eyes.
Truth is false and logic lost.
Now the fourth dimension is crossed.
You have entered the Twilight Zone.
Beyond this world strange things are known.
Use the key, unlock the door.
See what your fate might have in store.
Come explore your dreams' creation.
Enter this world of imagination.
Wake up lost in an empty town.
Wondering why no one else is around.
Look up to see a giant boy.
You've just become his brand new toy.
No escape, no place to hide.
Here where Time and Space collide.
Lessons.
Sweet memories Flashing very quickly by.
Reminding me Giving me a reason why.
I know that My goal is more than a thought.
I'll be there When I teach what I've been taught.
You know we've told you before.
But you didn't hear us then.
So you still question why.
You didn't listen again.
Sweet memories I never thought it would be like this.
Reminding me Just how close I came to missing.
I know that This is the way for me to go.
You'll be there When you know what I know.
Tears.
All of the seasons.
And all of the days.
All of the reasons.
Why I've felt this way.
So long.
So long.
Then lost in that feeling.
I looked in your eyes.
I noticed emotion.
And that you had cried.
For me.
I can see.
What would touch me deeper.
Tears that fall from eyes.
That only cry?.
Would it touch you deeper.
Than tears that fall from eyes.
That know why?.
A lifetime of questions.
Tears on your cheek.
I tasted the answers.
And my body was weak.
For you.
The truth.
Something For Nothing.
Waiting for the winds of change.
To sweep the clouds away.
Waiting for the rainbow's end.
To cast its gold your way.
Countless ways.
You pass the days.
Waiting for someone to call.
And turn your world around.
Looking for an answer to.
The question you have found.
Looking for.
An open door.
You don't get something for nothing.
You don't get freedom for free.
You won't get wise.
With the sleep still in your eyes.
No matter what your dreams might be.
What you own is your own kingdom.
What you do is your own glory.
What you love is your own power.
What you live is your own story.
In your head is the answer.
Let it guide you along.
Let your heart be the anchor.
And the beat of your own song.
A Farewell To Kings.
When they turn the pages of history.
When these days have passed long ago.
Will they read of us with sadness.
For the seeds that we let grow.
We turned our gaze.
From the castles in the distance.
Eyes cast down.
On the path of least resistance.
Cities full of hatred.
Fear and lies.
Withered hearts.
And cruel, tormented eyes.
Scheming demons.
Dressed in kingly guise.
Beating down the multitude.
And scoffing at the wise.
The hypocrites are slandering.
The sacred halls of Truth.
Ancient nobles showering.
Their bitterness on youth.
Can't we find.
The minds that made us strong.
Can't we learn.
To feel what's right and wrong.
Cities full of hatred.
Fear and lies.
Withered hearts.
And cruel, tormented eyes.
Scheming demons.
Dressed in kingly guise.
Beating down the multitude.
And scoffing at the wise.
Can't we raise our eyes.
And make a start.
Can't we find the minds.
To lead us closer to the Heart.
Xanadu.
"To seek the sacred river Alph.
To walk the caves of ice.
To break my fast on honey dew.
And drink the milk of Paradise...".
I had heard the whispered tales.
Of immortality.
The deepest mystery.
From an ancient book. I took a clue.
I scaled the frozen mountain tops.
Of eastern lands unknown.
Time and Man alone.
Searching for the lost - Xanadu.
Xanadu.
To stand within The Pleasure Dome.
Decreed by Kubla Khan.
To taste anew the fruits of life.
The last immortal man.
To find the sacred river Alph.
To walk the caves of ice.
Oh, I will dine on honey dew.
And drink the milk of Paradise.
A thousand years have come and gone.
But time has passed me by.
Stars stopped in the sky.
Frozen in an everlasting view.
Waiting for the world to end.
Weary of the night.
Praying for the light.
Prison of the lost - Xanadu.
Xanadu.
Held within The Pleasure Dome.
Decreed by Kubla Khan.
To taste my bitter triumph.
As a mad immortal man.
Nevermore shall I return.
Escape these caves of ice.
For I have dined on honey dew.
And drunk the milk of Paradise.
Closer to the Heart.
And the men who hold high places.
Must be the ones to start.
To mould a new reality.
Closer to the Heart.
The Blacksmith and the Artist.
Reflect it in their art.
Forge their creativity.
Closer to the Heart.
Philosophers and Ploughmen.
Each must know his part.
To sow a new mentality.
Closer to the Heart.
You can be the Captain.
I will draw the Chart.
Sailing into destiny.
Closer to the Heart.
Cinderella Man.
A modest man from Mandrake.
Travelled rich to the city.
He had a need to discover.
A use for his newly-found wealth.
Because he was human.
Because he had goodness.
Because he was moral.
They called him insane.
Delusions of grandeur.
Visions of splendour.
A manic depressive.
He walks in the rain.
Eyes wide open.
Heart undefended.
Innocence untarnished.
Cinderella Man.
Doing what you can.
They can't understand.
What it means.
Cinderella Man.
Hang on to your plans.
Try as they might.
They cannot steal your dreams.
In the betrayal of his love he awakened.
To face a world of cold reality.
And a look in the eyes of the hungry.
Awakened him to what he could do.
He held up his riches.
To challenge the hungry.
Purposeful motion.
For one so insane.
They tried to fight him.
Just couldn't beat him.
This manic depressive.
Who walks in the rain.
Madrigal.
When the dragons grow too mighty.
To slay with pen or sword.
I grow weary of the battle.
And the storm I walk toward.
When all around is madness.
And there's no safe port in view.
I long to turn my path homeward.
To stop awhile with you.
When life becomes so barren.
And as cold as winter skies.
There's a beacon in the darkness.
In a distant pair of eyes.
In vain to search for order.
In vain to search for truth.
But these things can still be given.
Your love has shown me proof.
In the constellation of Cygnus I set a course just east of Lyra.
There lurks a mysterious, invisible force And northwest of Pegasus.
The Black Hole Flew into the light of Deneb.
Of Cygnus X-1 Sailed across the Milky Way.
Six Stars of the Northern Cross On my ship, the 'Rocinante'.
In mourning for their sister's loss Wheeling through the galaxies,.
In a final flash of glory Headed for the heart of Cygnus.
Nevermore to grace the night... Headlong into mystery.
The x-ray is her siren song.
Invisible My ship cannot resist her long.
To telescopic eye Nearer to my deadly goal.
Infinity Until the Black Hole -.
The star that would not die Gains control....
All who dare.
To cross her course Spinning, whirling,.
Are swallowed by Still descending.
A fearsome force Like a spiral sea,.
Unending.
Through the void.
To be destroyed Sound and fury.
Or is there something more? Drowns my heart.
Atomized - at the core Every nerve.
Or through the Astral Door - Is torn apart.....
To soar....
To be continued.
Prelude I will soothe your primal fears I have memory and awareness.
When our weary world was young Throw off those chains of Reason But I have no shape or form.
The struggle of the Ancients first beganAnd your prison disappears' As a disembodied spirit.
The Gods of Love and Reason I am dead and yet unborn.
Sought alone to rule the fate of Man The cities were abandoned.
And the forests echoed song I have passed into Olympus.
They battled through the ages They danced and lived as brothers; As was told in tales of old.
But still neither force would yield They knew Love could not be wrong To the city of Immortals.
The people were divided Marble white and purest gold.
Every soul a battlefield... Food and wine they had aplenty.
And they slept beneath the stars I see the Gods in battle rage on high.
Apollo Bringer of Wisdom The people were contented Thunderbolts across the sky.
'I bring Truth and Understanding And the Gods watched from afar I cannot move, I cannot hide.
I bring Wit and Wisdom fair I feel a silent scream begin inside.
Precious gifts beyond compare But the winter fell upon them.
We can build a world of wonder And it caught them unprepared Then all at once the Chaos ceased.
I can make you all aware' Bringing wolves and cold starvation A stillness fell, a sudden peace.
And the hearts of men despaired... The Warriors felt my silent cry.
'I will find you food and shelter And stayed their struggle, mystified.
Show you fire to keep you warm IV. Armageddon The Battle of Heart.
Through the endless winter storm and Mind Apollo was atonished.
You can live in grace and comfort The Universe divided Dionysus thought me mad.
In the world that you transform.' As the Heart and Mind collided But they heard my story further.
With the people left unguided And they wondered, and were sad.
The people were delighted For so many troubled years.
Coming forth to claim their prize In a cloud of doubts and fears Looking down from Olympus.
They ran to build their cities Their world was torn asunder On a world of doubt and fear.
And converse among the wise Into hollow hemispheres Its surface splintered.
Into sorry hemispheres.
But one day the streets fell silent Some fought themselves, some fought.
Yet they knew not what was wrong each other They sat a while in silence.
The urge to build these fine things Most just followed one another Then they turned at last to me.
Seemed not to be so strong Lost and aimless like their brothers 'We will call you Cygnus,.
For their Hearts were so unclear The god of Balance you shall be'.
The wise men were consulted And the Truth could not appear.
And the Bridge of Death was crossed Their spirits were divided VI. The Sphere A Kind of Dream.
In quest of Dionysus Into blinded hemispheres We can walk our road together.
To find out what they had lost... If our goals are all the same.
Some who did not fight We can run alone and free.
Dionysus Bringer of Love Brought tales of old to light If we pursue a different aim.
'I bring Love to give you solace My 'Rocinante' sailed by night.
In the darkness of the night On her final flight Let the truth of love be lighted.
In the Heart's eternal light To the heart of Cygnus' fearsome force Let the love of truth shine clear.
You need only trust your feelings; We set our course Sensibility.
Only Love can steer you right' Spiralled through that timeless space Armed with sense and liberty.
To this immortal place With the Heart and Mind united.
'I bring Laughter, I bring Music In a single perfect sphere.
I bring Joy and I bring Tears V. Cygnus Bringer of Balance.
Circumstances.
A boy alone, so far from home.
Endless rooftops from my window.
I felt the gloom of empty rooms.
On rainy afternoons.
Sometimes in confusion.
I felt so lost and disillusioned.
Innocence gave me confidence.
To go up against reality.
All the same, we take our chances.
Laughed at by Time.
Tricked by Circumstances.
Plus ca change.
Plus c'est la meme chose.
The more that things change.
The more they stay the same.
Now I've gained some understanding.
Of the only world that we see.
Things that I once dreamed of.
Have become reality.
These walls that still surround me.
Still contain the same old me.
Just one more who's searching for.
A world that ought to be.
The Trees.
There is unrest in the forest.
There is trouble with the trees.
For the Maples want more sunlight.
And the Oaks ignore their pleas.
The trouble with the Maples.
(And they're quite convinced the're right).
They say the Oaks are just too lofty.
And they grab up all the light.
But the Oaks can't help their feelings.
If they like the way they're made.
And they wonder why the Maples.
Can't be happy in their shade?.
There is trouble in the forest.
And the creatures all have fled.
As the Maples scream 'Oppression!'.
And the Oaks, just shake their heads.
So the Maples formed a Union.
And demanded equal rights.
'The Oaks are just too greedy.
We will make them give us light'.
Now there's no more Oak oppression.
For they passed a noble law.
And the trees are all kept equal.
By hatchet,.
Axe,.
And saw....
The Spirit of Radio.
Begin the day.
With a friendly voice,.
A companion, unobtrusive.
Plays the song that's so elusive.
And the magic music makes your morning mood..
Off on your way.
Hit the open road,.
There is magic at your fingers.
For the Spirit ever lingers,.
Undemanding contact In your happy solitude..
Invisible airwaves.
Crackle with life.
Bright antennae bristle.
With the energy.
Emotional feedback.
On a timeless wavelength.
Bearing a gift beyond price-.
Almost free....
All this machinery.
Making modern music.
Can still be open-hearted.
Not so coldly charted.
It's really just a question.
Of your honesty.
One likes to believe.
In the freedom of music,.
But glittering prizes.
And endless compromises.
Shatter the illusion.
Of integrity..
"For the words of the profits,.
Are written on the studio wall,.
Concert hall -.
Echoes with the sounds....
Of salesmen.".
Freewill.
There are those who think that life.
Has nothing left to chance,.
A host of holy horrors.
To direct our aimless dance.
A planet of playthings.
We dance on the strings.
Of powers we cannot perceive.
"The stars aren't aligned -.
Or the gods are malign".
Blame is better to give than receive..
You can choose a ready guide.
In some celestial voice..
If you choose not to decide.
You still have made a choice.
You can choose from phantom fears.
And kindness that can kill;.
I will choose a path that's clear-.
I will choose free will.
There are those who think that.
They were dealt a losing hand,.
The cards were stacked against them-.
They weren't born in Lotus-Land.
All pre-ordained.
A prisoner in chains.
A victim of venomous fate.
Kicked in the face.
You can't pray for a place.
In heaven's unearthly estate.
Each of us.
A cell of awareness.
Imperfect and incomplete.
Genetic blends.
With uncertain ends.
On a fortune hunt.
That's far too fleet....
Jacob's Ladder.
The clouds prepare for battle.
In the dark and brooding silence.
Bruised and sullen stormclouds.
Have the light of day obscured.
Looming low and ominous.
In twilight premature.
Thunderheads are rumbling.
In a distant overture.
All at once,.
The clouds are parted.
Light streams down.
In bright unbroken beams.
Follow men's eyes.
As they look to the skies.
The shifting shafts of shining.
Weave the fabric of their dreams....
Entre Nous.
We are secrets to each other.
Each one's life a novel.
No-one else has read.
Even joined in bonds of love.
We're linked to one another.
By such slender threads.
We are planets to each other.
Drifting in our orbits.
To a brief eclipse.
Each of us a world apart.
Alone and yet together.
Like two passing ships.
Just between us.
I think it's time for us to recognize.
The differences we sometimes feared to show.
Just between us.
I think it's time for us to realize.
The spaces in between.
Leave room.
For you and I to grow.
We are strangers to each other.
Full of sliding panels.
An illusion show.
Acting well-rehearsed routines.
Or playing from the heart?.
It's hard for one to know.
We are islands to each other.
Building hopeful bridges.
On a troubled sea.
Some are burned or swept away.
Some we would not choose.
But we're not always free.
Different Strings.
Who's come to slay the dragon-.
Come to watch him fall?.
Making arrows out of pointed words.
Giant killers at the call.
Too much fuss and bother.
Too much contradiction and confusion.
Peel away the mystery.
Here's a clue to some real motivation.
All there really is.
The two of us.
And we both know why we've come along.
Nothing to explain.
It's a part of us.
To be found within a song.
What happened to our innocence-.
Did it go out of style?.
Along with our naivete'-.
No longer a child.
Different eyes see different things.
Different hearts beat on different strings.
But there are times.
For you and me.
When all such things agree..
Natural Science.
Tide Pools.
When the ebbing tide retreats Wheels within wheels.
Along the rocky shoreline In a spiral array.
It leaves a trail of tidal pools A pattern so grand.
In a short-lived galaxy And complex.
Each microcosmic planet Time after time.
A complete society We lose sight of the way.
Our causes can't see.
A simple kind of mirror Their effects..
To reflect upon our own.
All the busy little creatures III. Permanent Waves.
Chasing out their destinies Science, like nature.
Living in their pools Must also be tamed.
They soon forget about the sea... With a view towards its preservation.
Given the same.
State of integrity.
Wheels within wheels It will surely serve us well.
In a spiral array.
A pattern so grand Art as expression.
And complex Not as market campaigns.
Time after time Will still capture our imaginations.
We lose sight of the way Given the same.
Our causes can't see State of integrity.
Their effects. It will surely help us along.
Hyerspace The most endangered species.
A quantum leap forward The honest man.
In time and in space Will still survive annihilation.
The universe learned to expand Forming a world-.
The mess and the magic State of integrity.
Triumphant and tragic Sensitive, open and strong.
A mechanized world out of hand.
Computerized clinic.
For superior cynics Wave after wave.
Who dance to a synthetic band Will flow with the tide.
And bury the world as it does.
In their own image Tide after tide.
Their world is fashioned- Will flow and recede.
No wonder they don't understand Leaving life to go on.
As it was....
Tom Sawyer.
A modern-day warrior.
Mean mean stride,.
Today's Tom Sawyer.
Mean mean pride..
Though his mind is not for rent,.
Don't put him down as arrogant..
His reserve, a quiet defense,.
Riding out the day's events..
The river.
What you say about his company.
Is what you say about society..
-Catch the mist -Catch the myth.
-Catch the mystery -Catch the drift..
The world is, the world is,.
Love and life are deep,.
Maybe as his skies are wide..
Today's Tom Sawyer,.
He gets high on you,.
And the space he invades.
He gets by on you..
No, his mind is not for rent.
To any god or government..
Always hopeful, yet discontent,.
He knows changes aren't permanent,.
But change is..
What you say about his company.
Is what you say about society..
-Catch the witness -Catch the wit,.
-Catch the spirit -Catch the spit..
The world is, the world is,.
Love and life are deep,.
Maybe as his eyes are wide..
Exit the warrior,.
Today's Tom Sawyer,.
He gets high on you,.
And the energy you trade,.
He gets right on to the friction of the day..
Red Barchetta.
My uncle has a country place Wind-.
That no one knows about. In my hair-.
He says it used to be a farm, Shifting and drifting-.
Before the Motor Law. Mechanical music-.
And on Sundays I elude the Eyes, Adrenalin surge....
And hop the Turbine Freight.
To far outside the Wire, Well-weathered leather,.
Where my white-haired uncle waits. Hot metal and oil,.
The scented country air..
Jump to the ground Sunlight on chrome,.
As the Turbo slows to cross the Borderline. The blur of the landscape,.
Run like the wind, Every nerve aware..
As excitement shivers up and down my spine..
Down in his barn, Suddenly ahead of me,.
My uncle preserved for me an old machine, Across the mountainside,.
For fifty-odd years. A gleaming alloy air-car.
To keep it as new has been his dearest dream. Shoots towards me, two lanes wide..
I spin around with shrieking tires,.
I strip away the old debris To run the deadly race,.
That hides a shining car. Go screaming through the valley.
A brilliant red Barchetta As another joins the chase..
From a better, vanished time..
I fire up the willing engine, Drive like the wind,.
Responding with a roar. Straining the limits of machine and man..
Tires spitting gravel, Laughing out loud.
I commit my weekly crime... With fear and hope, I've got a desperate plan..
At the one-lane bridge.
I leave the giants stranded at the riverside..
Race back to the farm, to dream with my uncle at.
the fireside..
Limelight.
Living on a lighted stage.
Approaches the unreal.
For those who think and feel.
In touch with some reality.
Beyond the gilded cage..
Cast in this unlikely role,.
Ill-equipped to act,.
With insufficient tact,.
One must put up barriers.
To keep oneself intact..
Living in the Limelight,.
The universal dream.
For those who wish to seem..
Those who wish to be.
Must put aside the alienation,.
Get on with the fascination,.
The real relation,.
The underlying theme..
Living in a fisheye lens,.
Caught in the camera eye..
I have no heart to lie,.
I can't pretend a stranger.
Is a long-awaited friend..
All the world's indeed a stage,.
And we are merely players,.
Performers and portrayers,.
Each another's audience.
Outside the gilded cage..
Grim-faced and forbidding,.
Their faces closed tight,.
An angular mass of New Yorkers Wide-angle watcher.
Pacing in rhythm, On life's ancient tales,.
Race the oncoming night, Steeped in the history of London..
They chase through the streets of Manhattan..
Head-first humanity, Green and grey washes.
Pause at a light, In a wispy white veil.
Then flow through the streets of the city. Mist in the streets of Westminster..
Wistful and weathered,.
They seem oblivious The pride still prevails,.
To a soft spring rain, Alive in the streets of the city..
Like an English rain.
So light, yet endless Are they oblivious.
From a leaden sky. To this quality?.
A quality.
The buildings are lost Of light unique to.
In their limitless rise. Every city's streets..
My feet catch the pulse.
And the purposeful stride. Pavements may teem.
With intense energy,.
I feel the sense of possibilities, But the city is calm.
I feel the wrench of hard realities. In this violent sea..
The focus is sharp in the city..
The night is black,.
Without a moon..
The air is thick and still..
The vigilantes gather on.
The lonely torchlit hill..
Features distorted in the flickering light,.
The faces are twisted and grotesque..
Silent and stern in the sweltering night,.
The mob moves like demons possesed..
Quiet in conscience, calm in their right,.
Confident their ways are best..
The righteous rise.
With burning eyes.
Of hatred and ill-will..
Madmen fed on fear and lies.
To beat and burn and kill..
They say there are strangers who threaten us,.
In our immigrants and infidels..
They say there is strangeness, too dangerous.
In our theatres and bookstore shelves,.
That those who know what's best for us.
Must rise and save us from ourselves..
Quick to judge,.
Quick to anger,.
Slow to understand.
Ignorance and prejudice.
And fear.
Walk hand in hand..
Vital Signs.
Unstable condition,.
A symptom of life,.
In mental and environmental change..
Atmospheric disturbance,.
The feverish flux.
Of human interface and interchange..
The impulse is pure;.
Sometimes our circuits get shorted.
By external interference..
Signals get crossed.
And the balance distorted.
By internal incoherence..
A tired mind become a shape-shifter,.
Everybody need a mood lifter,.
Everybody need reverse polarity..
Everybody got mixed feelings.
About the function and the form..
Everybody got to deviate from the norm..
An ounce of perception,.
A pound of obscure..
Process information at half speed..
Pause, rewind, replay,.
Warm memory chip,.
Random sample, hold the one you need..
Leave out the fiction,.
The fact is, this friction.
Will only be worn by persistence..
Leave out conditions,.
Courageous convictions.
Will drag the dream into existence..
A tired mind become a shape-shifter,.
Everybody need a soft filter,.
Everybody need reverse polarity..
Everybody got mixed feelings.
About the function and the form..
Everybody got to elevate from the norm....
Subdivisions.
Sprawling on the fringes of the city.
In geometric order.
An insulated border.
In between the bright lights.
And the far unlit unknown.
Growing up it all seems so one-sided.
Opinions all provided.
The future pre-decided.
Detached and subdivided.
In the mass production zone.
Nowhere is the dreamer.
Or the misfit so alone.
Subdivisions -.
In the high school halls.
In the shopping malls.
Conform or be cast out.
Subdivisions -.
In the basement bars.
In the backs of cars.
Be cool or be cast out.
Any escape might help to smooth.
The unattractive truth.
But the suburbs have no charms to soothe.
The restless dreams of youth.
Drawn like moths we drift into the city.
The timeless old attraction.
Cruising for the action.
Lit up like a firefly.
Just to feel the living night.
Some will sell their dreams for small desires.
Or lose the race to rats.
Get caught in ticking traps.
And start to dream of somewhere.
To relax their restless flight.
Somewhere out of a memory.
Of lighted streets on quiet nights....
The Analog Kid.
A hot and windy August afternoon.
Has the trees in constant motion.
With a flash of silver leaves.
As they're rocking in the breeze.
The boy lies in the grass with one blade.
Stuck between his teeth.
A vague sensation quickens.
In his young and restless heart.
And a bright and nameless vision.
Has him longing to depart.
You move me -.
You move me -.
With your buildings and your eyes.
Autumn woods and winter skies.
You move me -.
You move me -.
Open sea and city lights.
Busy streets and dizzy heights.
You call me -.
You call me -.
The fawn-eyed girl with sun-browned legs.
Dances on the edge of his dream.
And her voice rings in his ears.
Like the music of the spheres.
The boy lies in the grass, unmoving.
Staring at the sky.
His mother starts to call him.
As a hawk goes soaring by.
The boy pulls down his baseball cap.
And covers up his eyes.
Too many hands on my time.
Too many feelings -.
Too many things on my mind.
When I leave I don't know.
What I'm hoping to find.
When I leave I don't know.
What I'm leaving behind....
Chemistry.
Signals transmitted.
Message received.
Reaction making impact -.
Invisibly.
Elemental telepathy.
Exchange of energy.
Reaction making contact -.
Mysteriously.
Eye to I.
Reaction burning hotter.
Two to one.
Reflection on the water.
H to O.
No flow without the other.
Oh but how.
Do they make contact.
With one another?.
Electricity? Biology?.
Seems to me it's Chemistry.
Emotion transmitted.
Emotion received.
Music in the abstract -.
Positively.
Elemental empathy.
A change of synergy.
Music making contact -.
Naturally.
One, two, three -.
Add without subtraction.
Sound on sound.
Multiplied reaction.
H to O.
No flow without the other.
Oh but how.
Do we make contact.
With one another?.
Digital Man.
His world is under observation -.
We monitor his station.
Under faces and the places.
Where he traces points of view.
He picks up scraps of conversation -.
Radio and radiation.
From the dancers and romancers.
With the answers - but no clue.
He'd love to spend the night in Zion.
He's been a long while in Babylon.
He'd like a lover's wings to fly on.
To a tropic isle of Avalon.
His world is under anaesthetic -.
Subdivided and synthetic.
His reliance on the giants.
In the science of the day.
He picks up scraps of information -.
He's adept at adaptation.
'Cause for strangers and arrangers.
Constant change is here to stay.
He's got a force field and a flexible plan.
He's got a date with fate in a black sedan.
He plays fast forward for as long as he can.
But he won't need a bed -.
He's a digital man.
We've got nothing to fear - but fear itself?.
Not pain or failure, not fatal tragedy?.
Not the faulty units in this mad machinery?.
Not the broken contacts in emotional chemistry?.
With an iron fist in a velvet glove.
We are sheltered under the gun.
In the glory game on the power train.
Thy kingdom's will be done.
And the things that we fear are a weapon to be held against us....
He's not afraid of your judgement.
He knows of horrors worse than your Hell.
He's a little bit afraid of dying -.
But he's a lot more afraid of your lying.
And the things that he fears.
Are a weapon to be held against him....
Can any part of life - be larger than life?.
Even love must be limited by time.
And those who push us down that they might climb -.
Is any killer worth more than his crime?.
Like a steely blade in a silken sheath.
We don't see what they're made of.
They shout about love, but when push comes to shove.
They live for the things they're afraid of.
And the knowledge that they fear.
Is a weapon to be used against them....
New World Man.
He's a rebel and a runner.
He's a signal turning green.
He's a restless young romantic.
Wants to run the big machine.
He's got a problem with his poisons.
But you know he'll find a cure.
He's cleaning up his systems.
To keep his nature pure.
Learning to match the beat of the Old World man.
Learning to catch the heat of the Third World man.
He's got to make his own mistakes.
And learn to mend the mess he makes.
He's old enough to know what's right.
But young enough not to choose it.
He's noble enough to win the world.
But weak enough to lose it -.
He's a New World man....
He's a radio receiver.
Tuned to factories and farms.
He's a writer and arranger.
And a young boy bearing arms.
He's got a problem with his power.
With weapons on patrol.
He's got to walk a fine line.
And keep his self-control.
Trying to save the day for the Old World man.
Trying to pave the way for the Third World man.
He's not concerned with yesterday.
He knows constant change is here today.
He's noble enough to know what's right.
But weak enough not to choose it.
He's wise enough to win the world.
But fool enough to lose it -.
He's a New World man....
Losing It.
The dancer slows her frantic pace.
In pain and desperation,.
Her aching limbs and downcast face.
Aglow with perspiration.
Stiff as wire, her lungs on fire,.
With just the briefest pause -.
The flooding through her memory,.
The echoes of old applause..
She limps across the floor.
And closes her bedroom door....
The writer stares with glassy eyes -.
Defies the empty page.
His beard is white, his face is lined.
And streaked with tears of rage..
Thirty years ago, how the words would flow.
With passion and precision,.
But now his mind is dark and dulled.
By sickness and indecision.
And he stares out the kitchen door.
Where the sun will rise no more....
Some are born to move the world -.
To live their fantasies.
But most of us just dream about.
The things we'd like to be.
Sadder still to watch it die.
Than never to have known it.
For you - the blind who once could see -.
The bell tolls for thee....
Countdown.
Dedicated with thanks to astronauts Young & Crippen and all the people of NASA for their inspiration.
and cooperation.
Lit up with anticipation.
We arrive at the launching site.
The sky is still dark, nearing dawn.
On the Florida coastline.
Circling choppers slash the night.
With roving searchlight beams.
This magic day when super-science.
Mingles with the bright stuff of dreams.
Floodlit in the hazy distance.
The star of this unearthly show.
Venting vapours, like the breath.
Of a sleeping white dragon.
Crackling speakers, voices tense.
Resume the final count.
All systems check, T minus nine.
As the sun and the drama start to mount.
The air is charged - a humid, motionless mass.
The crowds and the cameras,.
The cars full of spectators pass.
Excitement so thick - you could cut it with a knife.
Technology - high, on the leading edge of life.
The earth beneath us starts to tremble.
With the spreading of a low black cloud.
A thunderous roar shakes the air.
Like the whole world exploding.
Scorching blast of golden fire.
As it slowly leaves the ground.
Tears away with a mighty force.
The air is shattered by the awesome sound.
Like a pillar of cloud, the smoke lingers.
High in the air.
In fascination - with the eyes of the world.
We stare....
Distant Early Warning.
An ill wind comes arising.
Across the cities of the plain.
There's no swimming in the heavy water-.
No singing in the acid rain.
Red alert.
Red alert.
It's so hard to stay together.
Passing through revolving doors.
We need someone to talk to.
And someone to sweep the floors-.
Incomplete.
Incomplete.
The world weighs on my shoulders.
But what am I to do?.
You sometimes drive me crazy-.
But I worry about you.
I know it makes no difference.
To what you're going through.
But I see the tip of the iceberg-.
And I worry about you....
Cruising under your radar.
Watching from satellites.
Take a page from the red book-.
Keep them in your sights.
Red alert.
Red alert.
Left and rights of passage.
Black and whites of youth.
Who can face the knowledge.
That the truth is not the truth?.
Obsolete.
Absolute.
Absalom.
Absalom.
Afterimage.
Suddenly-.
You were gone.
From all the lives.
You left your mark upon.
I remember-.
How we talked and drank.
Into the misty dawn.
I hear the voices.
We ran by the water.
On the wet summer lawn.
I see the foot prints.
I remember-.
I feel the way you would.
I feel the way you would.
Tried to believe.
But you know it's no good.
This is something.
That just can't be understood.
I remember-.
The shouts of joy.
Skiing fast through the woods.
I hear the echoes.
I learned your love for life.
I feel the way that you would.
I feel your presence.
I remember-.
I feel the way you would.
This just can't be understood....
Red Sector A.
All that we can do is just survive.
All that we can do to help ourselves.
Is stay alive....
Ragged lines of ragged grey.
Skeletons, they shuffle away.
Shouting guards and smoking guns.
Will cut down the unlucky ones.
I clutch the wire fence.
Until my fingers bleed.
A wound that will not heal-.
A heart that cannot feel-.
Hoping that the horror will recede.
Hoping that tomorrow-.
We'll all be freed.
Sickness to insanity.
Prayer to profanity.
Days and weeks and months go by.
Don't feel the hunger-too weak to cry.
I hear the sound of gunfire.
At the prison gate.
Are the liberators here-.
Do I hope or do I fear?.
For my father and my brother-it's too late.
But I must help my mother.
Stand up straight....
Are we the last ones left alive?.
Are we the only human beings.
To survive?....
Things crawl in the darkness.
That imagination spins.
Needles at your nerve ends.
Crawl like spiders on your skin.
Pounding in your temples.
And a surge of adrenaline.
Every muscle tense-.
To fence.
The enemy within.
I'm not giving in.
To security under pressure.
I'm not missing out.
On the promise of adventure.
I'm not giving up.
On implausible dreams-.
Experience to extremes-.
Experience to extremes.
Suspicious-looking stranger.
Flashes you a dangerous grin.
Shadows across your window-.
Was it only trees in the wind?.
Every breath a static charge-.
A tongue that tastes like tin.
Steely-eyed outside to hide the enemy within....
To you-is it movement or is it action?.
It is contact or just reaction?.
And you-revolution or just resistance?.
Is it living, or just existence?.
eah, you-it takes a little more persistence.
To get up and go the distance....
The Body Electric.
One humanoid escapee.
One android on the run.
Seeking freedom beneath.
A lonely desert sun.
Trying to change its program.
Trying to change the mode-.
Crack the code.
Images conflicting.
Into data overload.
1-0-0-1-0-0-1.
S.O.S.
1-0-0-1-0-0-1.
In distress.
1-0-0-1-0-0.
Memory banks unloading.
Bytes break into bits.
Unit One's in trouble.
And it's scared out of its wits.
Guidance systems break down.
A struggle to exist-.
To resist-.
A pulse of dying power.
In a clenching plastic fist....
It replays each of the days.
A hundred years of routines.
Bows its head and prays.
To the mother of all machines....
Kid Gloves.
A world of difference.
A world so out of touch.
Overwhelmed by everything.
But wanting more so much-.
Call it blind frustration.
Call it blind man's bluff.
Call each other names-.
Your voices rude-your voices rough.
Then you learn the lesson.
That it's cool to be so tough.
Handle with kid gloves.
Handle with kid gloves.
Then you learn the lessons.
Taught in school won't be enough.
Put on your kid gloves.
Put on your kid gloves.
Then you learn the lesson.
That it's cool to be so tough.
A world of indifference.
Heads and hearts too full.
Careless of the consequence.
Of constant push and pull.
Anger got bare knuckles.
Anger play the fool.
Anger wear a crown of thorns.
Reverse the golden rule.
Then you learn the lesson.
That it's tough to be so cool.
Handle with kid gloves.
Handle with kid gloves.
Then you learn the weapons.
And the ways of hard-knock school.
Put on your kid gloves.
Put on your kid gloves.
Then you learn the lesson.
That it's tough to be so cool.
Red Lenses.
I see red.
It hurts my head.
Guess it must be something.
That i read.
It's the colour of your heartbeat.
A rising summer sun.
The battle lost-or won.
The flash to fashion.
And the pulse to passion-.
Feels red.
Inside my head.
And truth is often bitter-.
Left unsaid.
Said red red.
Thinking about the overhead-.
The underfed.
-couldn't we talk about something else instead?.
We've got mars on the horizon.
Says the national midnight star.
(it's true).
What you believe is what you are.
A pair of dancing shoes-.
The soviets are the blues-.
The reds.
Under your bed.
Lying-.
In the darkness.
Dead ahead.
And the mercury is rising.
Barometer starts to fall.
You know it gets to us all.
The pain that is learning.
And the rain that is burning-.
Feel red.
Still-go ahead.
You see black and white-.
And i see red (not blue).
Between The Wheels.
To live between a rock.
And a hard place.
In between time-.
Cruising in prime time-.
Soaking up the cathode rays.
To live between the wars.
In our time-.
Living in real time-.
Holding the good time-.
Holding on to yesterdays....
You know how that rabbit feels.
Going under your speeding wheels.
Bright images flashing by.
Like windshields towards a fly.
Frozen in the fatal climb-.
But the wheels of time-.
Just pass you by....
Wheels can take you around.
Wheels can cut you down.
We can go from boom to bust.
From dreams to a bowl of dust.
We can fall from rockets' red glare.
Down to "Brother can you spare-".
Another war-another waste land-.
And another lost generation....
It slips between your hands.
Like water.
This living in real time.
A dizzying lifetime.
Reeling by on celluloid.
Struck between the eyes.
By the big-time world.
Walking uneasy streets-.
Hiding beneath the sheets-.
Got to try and fill the void....
The Big Money.
Big money goes around the world.
Big money underground.
Big money got a mighty voice.
Big money make no sound.
Big money pull a million strings.
Big money hold the prize.
Big money weave a mighty web.
Big money draw the flies.
Sometimes pushing people around.
Sometimes pulling out the rug.
Sometimes pushing all the buttons.
Sometimes pulling out the plug.
It's the power and the glory.
It's a war in paradise.
It's a cinderella story.
On a tumble of the dice.
Big money goes around the world.
Big money take a cruise.
Big money leave a mighty wake.
Big money leave a bruise.
Big money make a million dreams.
Big money spin big deals.
Big money make a mighty head.
Big money spin big wheels.
Sometimes building ivory towers.
Sometimes knocking castles down.
Sometimes building you a stairway -.
Lock you underground.
It's that old-time religion.
it's the kingdom they would rule.
It's the fool on television.
Getting paid to play the fool.
Big money goes around the world.
Big money give and take.
Big money done a power of good.
Big money make mistakes.
Big money got a heavy hand.
Big money take control.
Big money got a mean streak.
Big money got no soul....
Grand Designs.
A to B -.
Different degrees....
So much style without substance.
So much stuff without style.
It's hard to recognize the real thing.
It comes along once in a while.
Like a rare and precious metal.
Beneath a ton of rock.
It takes some time and trouble.
To separate from the stock.
You sometimes have to listen to.
A lot of useless talk.
Shapes and forms.
Against the norms -.
Against the run of the mill.
Swimming against the stream.
Life in two dimensions.
Is a mass production scheme.
So much poison in power.
The principles get left out.
So much mind on the matter.
The spirit gets forgotten about.
Like a righteous inspiration.
Overlooked in haste.
Like a teardrop in the ocean.
A diamond in the waste.
Some world-views are spacious -.
And some are merely spaced.
Against the run of the mill.
Static as it seems.
We break the surface tension.
With our wild kinetic dreams.
Curves and lines -.
Of grand designs....
Manhattan Project.
Imagine a time when it all began.
In the dying days of a war.
A weapon - that would settle the score.
Whoever found it first.
Would be sure to do their worst -.
They always had before....
Imagine a man where it all began.
A scientist pacing the floor.
In each nation - always eager to explore.
To build the best big stick.
To turn the winning trick -.
But this was something more....
The big bang - took and shook the world.
Shot down the rising sun.
the end was begun - it would hit everyone.
When the chain reaction was done.
The big shots - try to hold it back.
Fools try to wish it away.
The hopeful depend on a world without end.
Whatever the hopeless may say.
Imagine a place where it all began.
They gathered from across the land.
To work in the secrecy of the desert sand.
All of the brightest boys.
To play with the biggest toys -.
More than they bargained for....
Imagine a man when it all began.
The pilot of "Enola Gay".
Flying out of the shockwave on that August day.
All the powers that be, and the course of history,.
Would be changed for evermore....
Marathon.
It's not how fast you can go That gets in your eyes.
The force goes into the flow One moment's high.
If you pick up the beat And glory rolls on by.
You can forget about the heat Like a streak of lightening.
That flashes and fades.
More than just survival In the summer sky.
More than just a flash.
More than just a dotted line Your meters may overload.
More than just a dash You can rest at the side of the road.
You can miss a stride.
It's a test of ultimate will But nobody gets a free ride.
The heartbreak climb uphill.
Got to pick up the pace More than high performance.
If you want to stay in the race More than just a spark.
More than just the bottom line.
More than just blind ambition Or a lucky shot in the dark -.
More than just simple greed.
More than just a finish line In the long run....
Must feed this burning need -.
You can do a lot in a lifetime.
In the long run... If you don't burn out too fast.
You can make the most of the distance.
From first to last First you need endurance -.
The peak is never passed First you've got to last....
Something always fires the light.
Territories.
I see the Middle Kingdom between Heaven and Earth.
Like the Chinese call the country of their birth.
We all figure that our homes are set above.
Other people than the ones we know and love.
In every place with a name.
They play the same territorial game.
Hiding behind the lines.
Sending up warning signs.
The whole wide world.
An endless universe.
Yet we keep looking through.
The eyeglass in reverse.
Don't feed the people.
But we feed the machines.
Can't really feel.
What international means.
In different circles.
We keep holding our ground.
Indifferent circles.
We keep spinning round and round.
We see so many tribes - overrun and undermined.
While their invaders dream of lands they've left behind.
Better people - better food - and better beer.
Why move around the world when Eden was so near?.
The bosses get talking so tough.
And if that wasn't evil enough.
We get the drunken and passionate pride.
Of the citizens along for the ride.
They shoot without shame.
In the name of a piece of dirt.
For a change of accent.
Or the colour of your shirt.
Better the pride that resides.
In a citizen of the world.
Than the pride that divides.
When a colourful rag is unfurled.
Middletown Dreams.
The office door closed early.
The hidden bottle came out.
The salesman turned to close the blinds.
A little slow now, a little stout.
But he's still heading down those tracks.
Any day now for sure.
Another day as drab as today.
Is more than a man can endure.
Dreams flow across the heartland.
Feeding on the fires.
Dreams transport desires.
Drive you when you're down -.
Dreams transport the ones.
Who need to get out of town.
The boy walks with his best friend.
Through the fields of early May.
They walk awhile in silence.
One close - one far away.
But he'd be climbing on that bus.
Just him and his guitar.
To blaze across the heavens.
Like a brilliant shooting star.
The middle-aged madonna.
Calls her neighbour on the phone.
Day by day the seasons pass.
And leave her life alone.
But she'll go walking out that door.
On some bright afternoon.
To go and paint big cities.
From a lonely attic room.
It's understood.
By every single person.
Who'd be elsewhere if they could.
So far so good.
And life's not unpleasant.
In their little neighbourhood.
They dream in Middletown....
Emotion Detector.
When we lift the covers from our feelings.
We expose our insecure spots.
Trust is just as rare as devotion -.
Forgive us our cynical thoughts.
If we need too much attention -.
Not content with being cool.
We must throw ourselves wide open.
And start acting like a fool.
If we need too much approval.
Then the cuts can seem too cruel.
Right to the heart of the matter.
Right to the beautiful part.
Illusions are painfully shattered.
Right where discovery starts.
In the secret wells of emotion.
Buried deep in our hearts.
It's true that love can change us.
But never quite enough.
Sometimes we are too tender.
Sometimes we're too tough.
If we get too much attention.
It gets hard to overrule.
So often fragile power turns.
To scorn and ridicule.
Sometimes our big splashes.
Are just ripples in the pool.
Feelings run high.
Mystic Rhythms.
So many things I think about.
When I look far away.
Things I know - things I wonder.
Things I'd like to say.
The more we think we know about.
The greater the unknown.
We suspend our disbelief.
And we are not alone -.
Mystic rhythms - capture my thoughts.
And carry them away.
Mysteries of night.
Escape the light of day.
Mystic rhythms - under northern lights.
Or the African Sun.
Primitive things stir.
The hearts of everyone.
We sometimes catch a window.
A glimpse of what's beyond.
Was it just imagination.
Stringing us along?.
More things than are dreamed about.
Unseen and unexplained.
We suspend our disbelief.
And we are entertained.
Mystic rhythms - capture my thoughts.
And carry them away.
Nature seems to spin.
A supernatural way.
Mystic rhythms - under city lights.
Or a canopy of stars.
We feel the powers.
And we wonder what they are.
We feel the push and pull.
Of restless rhythms from afar.
Force Ten.
Tough times demand tough talk.
demand tough hearts demand tough songs.
demand-.
We can rise and fall like empires.
Flow in and out like the tide.
Be vain and smart, humble and dumb.
We can hit and miss like pride.
We can circle around like hurricanes.
Dance and dream like lovers.
Attack the day like birds of prey.
Or scavengers under cover.
Look in-.
To the eye of the storm.
Look out-.
For the force without form.
Look around-.
At the sight and the sound.
Look in look out look around-.
We can move with savage grace.
To the rhythms of the night.
Cool and remote like dancing girls.
In the heat of the beat and the lights.
We can wear the rose of romance.
An air of joie de vivre.
Too-tender hearts upon our sleeves.
Or skin as thick as thieves'.
rising falling at force ten.
we twist the world and ride the wind.
Look in- look the storm in the eye.
Look out- to the sea and the sky.
Look around- at the sight and the sound.
Look in look out look around-.
Time Stand Still.
I turn my back to the wind Freeze this moment a little bit longer.
To catch my breath, Make each sensation a little bit stronger.
Before I start off again. Experience slips away....
Driven on,.
Without a moment to spend I turn my face to the sun.
To pass an evening Close my eyes..
With a drink and a friend Let my defences down-.
All those wounds.
I let my skin get too thin That I can't get unwound.
I'd like to pause,.
No matter what I pretend I let my past go too fast.
Like some pilgrim- No time to pause-.
Who learns to transcend- If I could slow it all down.
Learns to live Like some captain,.
As if each step was the end Whose ship runs aground-.
I can wait until the tide comes around.
Time stand still-.
I'm not looking back Make each impression a little bit stronger.
But I want to look around me now Freeze this motion a little bit longer.
See more of the people The innocence slips away....
And the places that surround me now.
Summer's going fast,.
Nights growing colder.
Children growing up-.
Old friends growing older.
Experience slips away....
Open Secrets.
It went right by me-.
At the time it went over my head.
I was looking out the window.
I should have looked at your face instead.
It went right by me-.
Just another wall.
There should have been a moment.
When we let our barriers fall.
I never meant what you're thinking-.
That is not what I meant at all....
Well I guess we all have these feelings.
We can't leave unreconciled.
Some of them burned on our ceilings.
Some of them learned as a child.
The things that we're concealing.
Will never let us grow.
Time will do its healing.
You've got to let it go.
Closed for my protection-.
Open to your scorn.
Between these two directions.
My heart is sometimes torn.
I lie awake with my secrets.
spinning around my head.
something that somehow escaped me-.
Something you shouldn't have said.
I was looking out the window.
I should have looked at your face instead....
I find no absolution.
In my rational point of view.
Maybe some things are instinctive.
But there's one thing you could do.
You could try to understand me-.
I could try to understand you....
Second Nature.
A memo to a higher office Folks have got to make choices-.
Open letter to the powers-that-be And choices got to have voices.
To a God, a king, a head of state Folks are basically decent.
A captain of industry Conventional wisdom would say.
To the movers and the shakers- Well, we read about the exceptions.
Can't everybody see? In the papers every day.
It ought to be second nature- It ought to be second nature-.
I mean, the places where we live! At least, that's what I feel.
Let's talk about this sensibly- "Now I lay me down in Dreamland"-.
We're not insensitive I know perfect's not for real.
I know progress has no patience- I thought we might get closer-.
But something's got to give But I'm ready to make a deal.
I know you're different- Today is different,.
You know I'm the same And tomorrow the same.
We're both too busy It's hard to take the world.
To be taking the blame The way that it came.
I'd like some changes Too many rapids.
But you don't have the time Keep us sweeping along.
We can't go on thinking Too many captains.
It's a victimless crime Keep on steering us wrong.
No one is blameless It's hard to take the heat-.
But we're all without shame It's hard to lay blame.
We fight the fire- To fight the fire-.
While we're feeding the flames While we're feeding the flames.
Prime Mover.
Basic elemental instinct to survive Alternating currents force a show of hands.
Stirs the higher passions Rational responses force a change of plans.
Thrill to be alive Anything can happen.
Alternating currents in a tidewater surge.
Rational resistance to an unwise urge From a point on the compass.
To magnetic north.
Anything can happen The point of the needle moving back and forth.
From the point of conception From the point of entry-.
To the moment of truth Until the candle is burned.
At the point of surrender The point of departure is not to return.
To the burden of proof.
Anything can happen.
From the point of ignition.
To the final drive I set the wheels in motion.
The point of the journey is not to arrive Turn up all the machines.
Activate the programs.
Anything can happen And run behind the scene.
Basic temperamental filters on our eyes I set the clouds in motion.
Alter our perceptions Turn up light and sound.
Lenses polarize Activate the window.
And watch the world go 'round-.
Anything can happen.
Lock And Key.
I don't want to face.
The killer instinct-.
Face it in your or me.
We carry a sensitive cargo.
Below the waterline-.
Ticking like a time bomb.
With a primitive design.
Behind the finer feelings-.
This civilized veneer-.
The heart of a lonely hunter.
Guards a dangerous frontier.
The balance can sometimes fail-.
Strong emotions can tip the scale-.
Don't want to silence.
A desperate voice.
For the sake of security.
No one wants to make a terrible choice.
On the price of being free.
I don't want to face the killer instinct-.
Face it in you or me.
So we keep it under lock and key....
It's not a matter of mercy.
It's not a matter of laws.
Plenty of people will kill you for some fanatical cause.
It's not a matter of conscience-.
A search for probable cause.
It's just a matter of instinct- a matter of fatal flaws.
No reward for resistance.
No assistance-.
No applause....
We don't want to be victims.
On that we all agree,.
So we lock up the killer instinct-.
And throw away the key....
Mission.
Hold your fire- I watch their images flicker.
Keep it burning bright Bringing light to a lifeless screen.
Hold the flame 'til the dream ignites- I walk through their beautiful buildings.
A spirit with a vision is a dream with a mission And I wish I had their dreams.
I hear their passionate music But dreams don't need to have motion.
Read the words that touch my heart To keep their spark alive.
I gaze at their feverish pictures Obsession has to have action-.
The secrets that set them apart Pride turns on the drive.
When I feel the powerful visions It's cold comfort.
Their fire has made alive To the ones without it.
I wish I had that instinct- To know how they struggled-.
I wish I had that drive How they suffered about it.
Spirits fly on dangerous missions If their lives were exotic and strange.
Imaginations on fire They would likely have gladly exchanged them.
Focused high on soaring ambitions For something a little more plain.
Consumed in a single desire Maybe something a little more sane.
In the grip of a nameless possession- We each pay a fabulous price.
A slave to the drive of obsession- For our visions of paradise.
A spirit with a vision But a spirit with a vision.
Is a dream with a mission... Is a dream with a mission....
Turn The Page.
Nothing can survive in a vacuum.
No one can exist all alone.
We pretend things only happen to strangers.
We've all got problems of our own.
It's enough to learn to share our pleasures.
We can't sooth pain with sympathy.
All that we can do is be reminded-.
We shake our heads at the tragedy.
Every day we're standing in a time capsule.
Racing down a river from the past.
Every day we're standing in a wind tunnel.
Facing down the future coming fast.
It's just the age.
It's just a stage-.
We disengage-.
We turn the page....
Looking at the long-range forecast.
Catching all the names in the news.
Checking out the state of the nation.
Learning the environmental blues.
Truth is after all a moving target.
Hairs to split, and pieces that don't fit.
How can anybody be enlightened?.
Truth is after all so poorly lit.
Tai Shan.
High on the sacred mountain.
Up the seven thousand stairs.
In the golden light of autumn.
There was magic in the air.
Clouds surrounded the summit.
The wind blew strong and cold.
Among the silent temples.
And the writing carved in gold.
Somewhere in my instincts.
The primitive took hold....
I stood at the top of the mountain.
And China sang to me.
In the peaceful haze of harvest time.
A song of eternity-.
If you raise your hands to heaven.
You will live a hundred years.
I stood there like a mystic.
Lost in the atmosphere.
The clouds were suddenly parted.
For a moment I could see.
The patterns of the landscape.
Reaching to the eastern sea.
I looked upon a presence.
Spanning forty centuries....
I thought of time and distance.
The hardships of history.
I heard the hope and the hunger.
When China sang to me....
High Water.
When the waters rose in the darkness.
In the wake of the endless flood.
It flowed into our memory-.
It flowed into our blood-.
When something broke the surface.
Just to see the starry dome-.
We still feel that relation.
When the water takes us home.
In the flying spray of the ocean.
The water takes you home-.
Springing from the weight of the mountains.
Like the heart of the earth would burst.
Flowing out from marble fountains.
In the dreams of a desert thirst.
Something swam through the jungles.
Where the mighty rivers roam-.
Something breaks the silence.
When the water takes you home.
I hear the wordless voices.
When the water takes me home-.
Waves that crash on the shoreline.
Torrents of tropical rain streaming down.
Beyond our memory.
Streaming down inside our veins.
When something left the ocean.
To crawl high above the foam-.
We still feel that elation.
When the water takes us home.
In a driving rain of redemption.
The water takes me home....
Show Don't Tell.
How many times do you hear it?.
It goes on all day long I'll give it due reflection.
Everyone knows everything Watching from the fence.
And no one's ever wrong Give the jury direction.
Until later Based on the evidence.
I, the jury.
Who can you believe?.
It's hard to play it safe Show me don't tell me.
But apart from a few good friends Hey - order in the court.
We don't take anything on faith Show me don't tell me.
Until later Let's try to keep it short.
Show me don't tell me.
Show don't tell Enough of your demands.
Show me don't tell me.
Show me don't tell me Witness take the stand.
You've figured out the score Show me don't tell me.
Show me don't tell me.
I've heard it all before Show me don't tell me.
Show me don't tell me Hey - order in the court.
I don't care what you say Show me don't tell me.
Show me don't tell me Let's try to keep it short.
Show me don't tell me.
You can twist perceptions I don't care what you say.
Reality won't budge Show me don't tell me.
You can raise objections Let's see exhibit a.
I will be the judge.
And the jury.
Chain Lightning.
Energy is contagious.
Enthusiasm spreads.
Tides respond to lunar gravitation.
Everything turns in synchronous relation.
Laughter is infectious.
Excitement goes to my head.
Winds are stirred by planets in rotation.
Sparks ignite and spread new information.
Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate.
Sun dogs fire on the horizon.
Meteor rain stars across the night.
This moment may be brief.
But it can be so bright.
Hope is epidemic.
Optimism spreads.
Bitterness breeds irritation.
Ignorance breeds imitation.
Sun dogs fire on the horizon.
Meteor rain stars across the night.
This moment may be brief.
But it can be so bright.
Reflected in another source of light.
When the moment dies.
The spark still flies.
Reflected in another pair of eyes.
Dreams are sometimes catching.
Desire goes to my head.
Love responds to your invitation.
Love responds to imagination.
Respond, vibrate, feed back, resonate.
The Pass.
Proud swagger out of the schoolyard.
Waiting for the world's applause.
Rebel without a conscience.
Martyr without a cause.
Static on your frequency.
Electrical storm in your veins.
Raging at unreachable glory.
Straining at invisible chains.
And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge.
Staring down into a heartless sea.
Can't face life on a razor's edge.
Nothing's what you thought it would be.
All of us get lost in the darkness.
Dreamers learn to steer by the stars.
All of us do time in the gutter.
Dreamers turn to look at the cars.
Turn around and turn around and turn around.
Turn around and walk the razor's edge.
Don't turn your back.
And slam the door on me.
It's not as if this barricade.
Blocks the only road.
It's not as if you're all alone.
In wanting to explode.
Someone set a bad example.
Made surrender seem all right.
The act of a noble warrior.
Who lost the will to fight.
And now you're trembling on a rocky ledge.
Staring down into a heartless sea.
Done with life on a razor's edge.
Nothing's what you thought it would be.
No hero in your tragedy.
No daring in your escape.
No salutes for your surrender.
Nothing noble in your fate.
Christ, what have you done?.
War Paint.
Girl before the mirror It has to be tonight.
Appraises her disguise He can take the princess.
Child become a mother If he can take the fight.
Tries to fix her eyes.
No more of his excuses Pound the drums with martial beat.
It has to be today Pound the streets with marching feet.
She can keep her fantasy Wounded pride, distorted eyes.
If she can get away Paint the night with battlecries.
Paint her name on a one-way street All puffed up with vanity.
Painted cheeks with angry heat We see what we want to see.
Wounded pride on painted eyes To the powerful and the wise.
Paint the night with battlecries The mirror always lies.
All puffed up with vanity Boys and girls together.
We see what we want to see Mistake conceit for pride.
To the beautiful and the wise - ambition for illusion.
The mirror always lies - dreams for self-delusion.
Girls and boys together.
Boy before the mirror See what it is we lack.
Checks his camoflauge Boys and girls together.
Polishes his armor Let's paint the mirror black.
And the charger in the garage Paint it black.
No more lame excuses.
Scars.
I've stood upon my mountaintop.
And shouted at the sky.
Walked above the pavement.
With my sense amplified.
- i get this feeling.
All my nerves are naked wires.
Tender to the touch.
Sometimes super-sensitive.
But who can care too much?.
- i get this feeling.
Scars of pleasure.
Scars of pain.
Atmospheric changes.
Make them sensitive again.
Each emotional injury.
Leaves behind its mark.
Sometimes they come tumbling out.
Like shadows in the dark.
- i get this feeling.
When i think about all i have seen.
And all i'll never see.
When i think about the people.
Who have opened up to me.
- i get this feeling.
Snow falls deep around my house.
And holds the winter light.
I've heard the lions hunting.
In the serengeti night.
- i get this feeling.
Forests turned to factories.
And river, sea, and sky.
Hungry child in the desert.
And the flies that cloud her eyes.
- i get this feeling.
Pleasure leaves a fingerprint.
As surely as mortal pain.
In memories they resonate.
And echo back again.
If i could wave my magic wand... I had a dream of the open water.
I was swimming away out to sea.
I am made from the dust of the stars So deep i could never touch bottom.
And the oceans flow in my veins What a fool i used to be.
Here i hide in the heart of the city.
Like a stranger coming out of the rain If i could wave my magic wand.
I'd set everybody free.
The evening plane rises up from the runway.
Over constellations of light I'm not one to believe in magic.
I look down into a million houses Though my memory has a second-sight.
And wonder what you're doing tonight I'm not one to go pointing my finger.
When i radiate more heat than light.
If i could wave my magic wand.
I'd make everything all right Don't ask me.
I'm just improvising.
I'm not one to believe in magic My illusion of careless flight.
But i sometimes have a second-sight Can't you see.
I'm not one with a sense of proportion My temperature's rising.
When my heart still changes overnight I radiate more heat than light.
I had a dream of a winter garden Don't ask me.
A midnight rendezvous I'm just sympathizing.
Silver, blue, and frozen silence My illusions a harmless flight.
What a fool i was for you Can't you see.
My temperature's rising.
I radiate more heat than light.
Superconductor.
Packaged like a rebel or a hero He can put a target on the market.
Target mass appeal Bask in your applause.
To make an audience feel Reality withdraws.
He really means it Now he believes it.
Package the illusion of persona The role becomes the actor.
Careful to conceal She's addicted to applause.
The fact that she's only too real The stage a world because.
She's got to screen it She never leaves it.
Hit you in a soft place Hit you in a soft place.
A melody so sweet With sentimental ease.
A strong and simple beat They know the fantasies.
That you can dance to That you romance to.
Watch his every move Watch her every move.
Superconductor Superconductor.
Orchestrate illusions She can manipulate reactions.
Superconductor Superconductor.
Watch his every move Watch her every move.
Superconductor Superconductor.
Hoping you'll believe Pin the donkeys on her tail.
Designing to deceive Fantasy for sale.
That's entertainment That's entertainment....
Anagram (For Mongo).
There's a snake coming out of the darkness.
Parade from paradise.
End the need for eden.
Chase the dreams of merchandise.
There is tic and toc in atomic.
Leaders make a deal.
The cosmic is largely comic.
A con they couldn't conceal.
There is no safe seat at the feast.
Take your best stab at the beast.
The night is turning thin.
The saint is turning to sin.
Raise the art to resistance.
Danger dare to be grand.
Pride reduced to humble pie.
Diamonds down to sand.
Take heart from earth and weather.
The brightness of new birth.
Take heart from the harvest.
Shave the harvest from the earth.
Reasoning is partly insane.
Image just an eyeless game.
The night is turning thin.
The saint is turning to sin.
Miracles will have their claimers.
More will bow to rome.
He and she are in the house.
But there's only me at home.
Rose is a rose of splendor.
Posed to respond in the end.
Lonely things like nights,.
I find, end finer with a friend.
I hear in the rate of her heart.
A tear in the heat of the art.
The night turns thin.
The saint turns to sin.
Red Tide.
Nature has some new plague.
To run in our streets.
History some new wrinkle.
We are doomed to repeat.
Fugitives at the bedroom door.
Lovers pause to find an open store.
Rain is burning on the forest floor.
And the red tide kisses the shore.
This is not a false alarm.
This is not a test.
Stay out of the sun.
It only burns my skin.
Sky full of poison.
And the atmosphere's too thin.
Bless the sun, the rain no more.
River running like an open sore.
Black wind falling to the ocean floor.
And the red tide washes ashore.
This is not a false alarm.
This is not a test.
Nowhere we can fly away.
Nowhere we can rest.
The party is disrupted by.
An uninvited guest.
Deadline approaches.
For the weary land.
It used to be something.
But we let it run down in our hands.
Too late for debate, too bad to ignore.
Quiet rebellion leads to open war.
Bring a sea-change to the factory floor.
As the red tide covers the shore.
Now's the time to turn the tide.
Now's the time to fight.
Let us not go gently.
To the endless winter night.
Now's the time to make the time.
While hope is still in sight.
Let us not go gently.
To the endless winter night.
Hand Over Fist.
Hand over fist.
Paper around the stone You talk as we walk along.
Scissors cut the paper You never imagined i could be so wrong.
Cut the paper to the bone Humming your favorite song.
Hand over fist You know i've hated that song for so long.
Paper around the stone.
Scissors cut the paper How can we ever agree?.
And the rock must stand alone Like the rest of the world.
We grow farther apart.
I could disappear into the crowd I swear you don't listen to me.
But not if i keep my head in the clouds Holding my hand to my heart.
I could walk away so proud Holding my fist to my racing heart.
It's easy enough if you don't laugh too loud.
Take a walk outside myself.
I thought i was okay alone In some exotic land.
Wait for the postman and the telephone Greet a passing stranger.
Lost in a world of my own Feel the strength in his hand.
I thought i could run alone Feel the world expand.
Thought i could run through the night alone.
I feel my spirit resist.
Hand over hand But i open up my fist.
Doesn't seem so much Lay hand over hand over.
Hand over hand Hand over fist.
Is the strength of the common touch.
Available Light.
The restless wind.
Has seen all things Trick of light.
In every kind of light Moving picture.
Rising with the full moon Moments caught in flight.
To go howling through the night Make the shadows darker.
Or the colors shine too bright.
The sleepless wind.
Has heard all things Oh the light can carry.
Between the sea and sky All the visions of the sea.
In the canyons of the city Oh the light can carry.
You can hear the buildings cry All the images to me.
Oh the wind can carry Run to light from shadow.
All the voices of the sea Sun gives me no rest.
Oh the wind can carry Promise offered in the east.
All the echoes home to me Broken in the west.
Chase the sun around the world.
Run with wind and weather I want to look at life - in the available light.
To the music of the sea.
All four winds together All four winds together.
Can't bring the world to me Can't bring the world to me.
Chase the wind around the world Shadows hide the play of light.
I want to look at life - in the available light So much i want to see.
Chase the light around the world.
Play of light I want to look at life - in the available light.
A photograph.
The way i used to be I'll go with the wind.
Some half-forgotten stranger I'll stand in the light.
Doesn't mean that much to me.
Dreamline.
He's got a road map of Jupiter.
A radar fix on the stars.
All along the highway.
She's got a liquid-crystal compass.
A picture book of the rivers.
Under the Sahara.
They travel in the time of the prophets.
On a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun.
Like lovers and hereos, and the restless part of everyone.
We're only at home when we're on the run.
On the run.
He's got a star map of Hollywood.
A list of cheap motels.
All along the freeway.
She's got a sister out in Vegas.
The promise of a decent job.
Far away from her hometown.
They travel on the road to redemption.
A highway out of yesterday - that tomorrow will bring.
Like lovers and heroes, birds in the last days of spring.
We're only at home when we're on the wing.
On the wing.
When we are young.
Wandering the face of the earth.
Wondering what our dreams might be worth.
Learning that we're only immortal -.
For a limited time.
Time is a gypsy caravan.
Steals away in the night.
To leave you stranded in Dreamland.
Distance is a long-range filter.
Memory a flickering light.
Left behind in the heartland.
We travel in the dark of the new moon.
A starry highway traced on the map of the sky.
Like lovers and heroes, lonely as the eagle's cry.
We're only at home when we're on the fly.
On the fly.
We travel on the road to adventure.
On a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun.
Like lovers and hereos, and the restless part of everyone.
We're only at home when we're on the run.
Bravado.
If we burn our wings.
Flying too close to the sun.
If the moment of glory.
Is over before it's begun.
If the dream is won -.
Though everything is lost.
We will pay the price,.
But we will not count the cost.
When the dust has cleared.
And victory denied.
A summit too lofty.
River a little too wide.
If we keep our pride -.
Though paradise is lost.
We will pay the price,.
But we will not count the cost.
And if the music stops.
There's only the sound of the rain.
All the hope and glory.
All the sacrifice in vain.
If love remains.
Though everything is lost.
We will pay the price,.
But we will not count the cost.
Roll The Bones.
Well, you can stake that claim -.
Good work is the key to good fortune Jack - relax..
Winners take that praise Get busy with the facts..
Losers seldom take that blame No zodiacs or almanacs,.
If they don't take that game No maniacs in polyester slacks..
And sometimes the winner takes nothing Just the facts..
We draw our own designs Gonna kick some gluteus max..
But fortune has to make that frame It's a parallax - you dig?.
You move around.
We go out in the world and take our chances The small gets big. It's a rig.
Fate is just the weight of circumstances It's action - reaction -.
That's the way that lady luck dances Random interaction..
Roll the bones So who's afraid.
Of a little abstraction?.
Why are we here? Can't get no satisfaction.
Because we're here From the facts?.
Roll the bones You better run, homeboy -.
Why does it happen? A fact's a fact.
Because it happens From Nome to Rome, boy..
Roll the bones.
What's the deal? Spin the wheel..
Faith is cold as ice - If the dice are hot - take a shot..
Why are little ones born only to suffer Play your cards. Show us what you got -.
For the want of immunity What you're holding..
Or a bowl of rice? If the cards are cold,.
Well, who would hold a price Don't go folding..
On the heads of the innocent children Lady Luck is golden;.
If there's some immortal power She favors the bold. That's cold.
To control the dice? Stop throwing stones -.
The night has a thousand saxophones..
We come into the world and take our chances So get out there and rock,.
Fate is just the weight of circumstances And roll the bones..
That's the way that lady luck dances Get busy!.
Roll the bones....
Face Up.
You turn my head.
I spin my wheels.
Running on empty -.
You know how that feels.
I'm on a roll now -.
Or is it a slide?.
Can't be too careful.
With that dangerous pride.
If I could only reach that dial inside.
And turn it up.
Face up - or you can only back down.
Face up - hit the target, or you better hit the ground.
Face up - there's still time to turn the game around.
Face up - turn it up -.
Or turn that wild card down.
Turn it up.
Don't complain.
Don't explain.
I don't think my new resolve.
Can stand the strain.
I'm in a groove now -.
Or is it a rut?.
I need some feedback.
But all the lines are cut.
I get so angry, but I keep my mouth shut.
And turn it up.
You get all squeezed up inside.
Like the days were carved in stone.
You get all wired up inside.
And it's bad to be alone.
You can go out, you can take a ride.
And when you get out on your own.
You get all smoothed out inside.
And it's good to be alone.
Turn it up.
The Big Wheel.
Well, I was only a kid - didn't know enough to be afraid.
Playing the game, but not the way the big boys played.
Nothing to lose - maybe I had something to trade.
The way the big wheel spins.
Well, I was only a kid, on a holy crusade.
I placed no trust in a faith that was ready-made.
Take no chances on paradise delayed.
So I do a slow fade.
Playing for time.
Don't want to wait for heaven.
Looking for love.
For an angel to forgive my sins.
Playing with fire.
Chasing something new to believe in.
Looking for love.
The way the big wheel spins.
Well, I was only a kid, cruising around in a trance.
Prisoner of fate, victim of circumstance.
I was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advance.
The way the big wheel spins.
Well, I was only a kid, gone without a backward glance.
Going for broke, going for another chance.
Hoping for heaven - hoping for a fine romance.
If I do the right dance.
Wheel goes round, landing on a twist of faith.
Taking your chances you'll have the right answers.
When the final judgment begins.
Wheel goes round, landing on a leap of fate.
Life redirected in ways unexpected.
Sometimes the odd number wins.
The way the big wheel spins.
Heresy.
All around that dull gray world.
From Moscow to Berlin.
People storm the barricades.
Walls go tumbling in.
The counter-revolution.
People smiling through their tears.
Who can give them back their lives.
And all those wasted years?.
All those precious wasted years -.
Who will pay?.
All around that dull gray world.
Of ideology.
People storm the marketplace.
And buy up fantasy.
The counter-revolution.
At the counter of a store.
People buy the things they want.
And borrow for a little more.
All those wasted years.
All those precious wasted years.
Who will pay?.
Do we have to be forgiving at last?.
What else can we do?.
Do we have to say goodbye to the past?.
Yes I guess we do.
All around this great big world.
All the crap we had to take.
Bombs and basement fallout shelters.
All our lives at stake.
The bloody revolution.
All the warheads in its wake.
All the fear and suffering.
All a big mistake.
All those wasted years.
All those precious wasted years.
Who will pay?.
Ghost of a Chance.
Like a million little doorways.
All the choices we made.
All the stages we passed through.
All the roles we played.
For so many different directions.
Our separate paths might have turned.
With every door that we opened.
Every bridge that we burned.
Somehow we find each other.
Through all that masquerade.
Somehow we found each other.
Somehow we have stayed.
In a state of grace.
I don't believe in destiny.
Or the guiding hand of fate.
I don't believe in forever.
Or love as a mystical state.
I don't believe in the stars or the planets.
Or angels watching from above.
But i believe there's a ghost of a chance.
We can find someone to love.
And make it last.
Like a million little crossroads.
Through the backstreets of youth.
Each time we turn a new corner.
A tiny moment of truth.
So many different connections.
Our separate paths might have made.
With every door that we opened.
Every game we played.
Somehow we find each other.
Through all that masquerade.
Somehow we found each other.
Somehow we have stayed.
In a state of grace.
Neurotica.
You just don't get it.
What it is ... well, you're not really sure.
You move like you're walking on this ice.
Talking like you're still insecure.
Time is a spiral - Space is a curve.
I know you get dizzy, but try not to lose your nerve.
Life is a diamond you turn into dust.
Waiting for rescue, and I know you just.
Don't get it.
You just don't get it.
Neurotica - Exotica.
It's just Erotica - Hypnotica.
It's just Psychotica - Chaotica.
It's just Exotica - Neurotica.
You just don't get it.
Baby, don't you ask yourself why?.
If you don't like the answer - forget it.
You know I hate to see you cry.
Fortune is random - Fate shoots from the hip.
I know you get crazy, but try not to lose your grip.
Life is a diamond you turn into dust.
Looking for trust, and I know that you just.
Don't get it.
You just don't get it.
Snap!.
Hide in your shell, let the world go to hell.
It's like russian roulette to you.
Snap!.
Sweat running cold, you can't face growing old.
It's a personal threat to you.
Snap!.
The world is a cage for your impotent rage.
But don't let it get to you.
Snap!.

SPIT IT OUT.
Don't swallow the lies.
Natural reflex.
Pendulum swing.
You might be too dizzy.
To do the right thing.
Trial under fire.
Ultimate proof.
Moment of crisis.
Don't swallow the truth.
STICK IT OUT.
Each time we bathe our reactions.
In artificial light.
Each time we alter the focus.
To make the wrong moves seem right.
You get so used to deception.
You make yourself a nervous wreck.
You get so used to surrender.
Running back to cover your neck.
STICK IT OUT.
Cut To The Chase.
It is the fire that lights itself.
But it burns with a restless flame.
The arrow on a moving target.
The archer must be sure of his aim.
It is the engine that drives itself.
But it chooses the uphill climb.
A bearing on magnetic north.
Growing farther away all the time.
Can't stop - moving.
Can't stop - moving.
Can't stop.
You may be right.
It's all a waste of time.
I guess that's just a chance.
I'm prepared to take.
A danger i'm prepared to face.
Cut to the chase.
It is the rocket that ignites itself.
And launches its way to the stars.
A driver on a busy freeway.
Racing the oblivious cars.
It's the motor of the western world.
Spinning off to every extreme.
Pure as a lover's desire.
Evil as a murderer's dream.
Young enough not to care too much.
About the way things used to be.
I'm young enough to remember the future -.
The past has no claim on me.
I'm old enough not to care too much.
About what you think of me.
But I'm young enough to remember the future.
And the way things ought to be.
What kind of difference.
Can one person make?.
Cut to the chase.
Nobody's Hero.
I knew he was different, in his sexuality.
I went to his parties, as a straight minority.
It never seemed a threat to my masculinity.
He only introduced me to a wider reality.
As the years went by, we drifted apart.
When I heard that he was gone.
I felt a shadow cross my heart.
But he's nobody's -.
Hero - saves a drowning child.
Cures a wasting disease.
Hero - lands the crippled airplane.
Solves great mysteries.
Hero - not the handsome actor.
Who plays a hero's role.
Hero - not the glamor girl.
Who'd love to sell her soul.
If anybody's buying.
Nobody's hero.
I didn't know the girl, but I knew her family.
All their lives were shattered.
in a nightmare of brutality.
They try to carry on, try to bear the agony.
Try to hold some faith.
in the goodness of humanity.
As the years went by, we drifted apart.
When I heard that she was gone.
I felt a shadow cross my heart.
But she's nobody's -.
Hero - the voice of reason.
Against the howling mob.
Hero - the pride of purpose.
In the unrewarding job.
Hero - not the champion player.
Who plays the perfect game.
Not the glamor boy.
Who loves to sell his name.
Everybody's buying.
Nobody's hero.
As the years went by, we drifted apart.
When I heard that you were gone.
I felt a shadow cross my heart.
Between Sun And Moon.
There is a lake between sun and moon.
Not too many know about.
In the silence between whisper and shout.
The space between wonder and doubt.
This is a fine place.
Shining face to face.
Those bonfire lights in the mirror of sky.
The space between wonder and why.
ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes.
why the sun why the sun.
There is a fine line between love and illusion -.
A fine place to penetrate.
The gap between actor and act.
The lens between wishes and fact.
This is a fine place.
To hesitate.
Those bonfire lights in the lake of sky.
The time between wonder and why.
Some need to pray to the sun at high noon.
Some need to howl at the midwinter moon.
Reborn and baptized in a moment of grace.
We just need a break -.
From the headlong race.
ahh yes to yes to ahh ahh to yes.
why the sun why the sun.
This is a fine place, shining face to face.
These bonfire lights in the mirrored sky.
The space between wonder and why.
Alien Shore.
You and I, we are strangers by one chromosome.
Slave to the hormone, body and soul.
In a struggle to be happy and free.
Swimming in a primitive sea.
You and I, we must dive below the surface.
A world of red neon, and ultramarine.
Shining bridges on the ocean floor.
Reaching to the alien shore.
For you and me - Sex is not a competition.
For you and me - Sex is not a job description.
For you and me - We agree.
You and I, we are pressed into these solitudes.
Color and culture, language and race.
Just variations on a theme.
Islands in a much larger stream.
For you and me - Race is not a competition.
For you and me - Race is not a definition.
For you and me - We agree.
Reaching for the alien shore.
You and I, we reject these narrow attitudes.
We add to each other, like a coral reef.
Building bridges on the ocean floor.
Reaching for the alien shore.
For you and me - We hold these truths to be self-evident.
For you and me - We'd elect each other president.
For you and me - We might agree.
But that's just us.
Reaching for the alien shore.
The Speed of Love.
Love is born with lightning bolts.
Electro-magnetic force.
Burning skin and fireworks.
A storm on a raging course.
Like a force of nature,.
Love can fade with the stars at dawn.
Sometimes it takes all your strength.
Just to keep holding on.
At the speed of love.
A radiance that travels.
At the speed of love.
My heart goes out to you..
Love is born with solar flares.
From two magnetic poles.
It moves towards a higher plane.
Where two halves make two wholes.
Like a force of nature,.
Love shines in many forms.
One night we are bathed in light.
One day carried away in the storms.
At the speed of love.
Nothing changes faster.
Than the speed of love.
My heart goes out to you.
We don't have to talk.
We don't even have to touch.
I can feel your presence.
In the silence that we share.
Got to keep moving.
At the speed of love.
Nothing changes faster.
Than the speed of love.
Got to keep on shining.
At the speed of love.
Nothing changes faster.
Than the speed of love.
My heart goes out to you.
Double Agent.
Where would you rather be? On the edge of sleep,.
Anywhere but here I heard voices behind the door.
When will the time be right? The known and the nameless,.
Anytime but now familiar and faceless.
My angels and my demons at war.
On the edge of sleep, Which one will lose - depends on what I choose.
I was drifting for half the night Or maybe which voice I ignore....
Anxious and restless,.
pressed down by the darkness Wilderness of mirrors.
Bound up and wound up so tight Streets of cold desire.
So many decisions, a million revisions My precious sense of honor.
Caught between darkness and light... Just a shield of rusty wire.
I hold against the chaos -.
Wilderness of mirrors And the cross of holy fire.
World of polished steel.
Gears and iron chains Wilderness of mirrors.
Turn the grinding wheel So easy to deceive.
I run between the shadows My precious sense of rightness.
Some are phantoms, some are real Is sometimes so naive.
So that which I imagine.
Where would you rather be? Is that which I believe.
Anywhere but here.
When will the time be right? On the edge of sleep, I awoke to a sun so bright.
Anytime but now Rested and fearless, cheered by your nearness.
The doubt and the fear I knew which direction was right.
I know would all disappear The case had been tried by the jury inside.
Anywhere but here The choice between darkness and light....
Cold Fire.
It was long after midnight.
When we got to unconditional love.
She said sure, my heart is boundless.
But don't push my limits too far.
I said if love was so transcendant.
I don't understand these boundaries.
She said just don't disappoint me -.
You know how complex women are.
I'll be around.
If you don't let me down.
Too far.
It was just before sunrise.
When we started on traditional roles.
She said sure I'll be your partner.
But don't make too many demands.
I said if love has these conditions.
I don't understand those songs you love.
She said this is not a love song.
This isn't fantasy-land.
I'll be around.
If you don't push me down.
Too far.
DON'T GO TOO FAR -.
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea.
Is a cold fire.
DON'T CROSS THE LINE -.
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor.
Is a cold fire.
DON'T LET ME DOWN -.
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond.
Is a cold fire.
DON'T BREAK THE SPELL -.
The look in your eyes as you head for the door.
Is a cold fire.
Love is blind if you are gentle.
Love can turn to a long, cold burn.
Everyday Glory.
In the house where nobody laughs.
And nobody sleeps.
In the house where love lies dying.
And the shadows creep.
A little girl hides, shaking,.
With her hands on her ears.
Pushing back the tears, 'til the pain disappears.
Mama says some ugly words.
Daddy pounds the wall.
They can fight about their little girl later.
Right now they don't care at all.
No matter what they say....
No matter what they say....
Everyday people.
Everyday shame.
Everyday promise.
Shot down in flames.
Everyday sunrise.
Another everyday story.
Rise from the ashes -.
A blaze of everyday glory.
In the city where nobody smiles.
And nobody dreams.
In the city where desperation.
Drives the bored to extremes.
Just one spark of decency.
Against a starless night.
One glow of hope and dignity.
A child can follow the light.
No matter what they say.
No matter what they say....
If the future's looking dark.
We're the ones who have to shine.
If there's no one in control.
We're the ones who draw the line.
Though we live in trying times -.
We're the ones who have to try.
Though we know that time has wings -.
We're the ones who have to fly.
Test For Echo.
Here we go - vertigo.
Video vertigo.
Test for echo.
Here we go - in slo-mo.
Video vertigo.
Test for echo.
Some kind of trouble on the sensory screen.
Camera curves over caved-in cop cars.
Bleacher-creatures, would-be desperados.
Clutch at plausible deniability.
Don't touch that dial -.
We're in denial.
Until the showcase trial on TV.
Some kind of pictures on the sense o'clock news.
Miles of yellow tape - silhouetted chalklines.
Tough-talking hood boys in pro-team logo knock-offs.
Conform to uniforms of some corporate entity.
Don't change that station.
It's Gangster Nation.
Now crime's in syndication on TV.
What a show - vertigo.
Video vertigo.
Test for echo.
Touch and go - in slo-mo.
Video vertigo.
Test for echo.
Some kind of drama live on satellite.
Hidden camera coverage from the crime scene to the courtroom.
Nail-biting hood boys in borrowed ties and jackets.
Clutching at the straws of respectability.
Can't do the time?.
Don't do the crime.
And wind up in the perp walk on TV.
Driven.
Driven up and down in circles.
Skidding down a road of black ice.
Staring in and out storm windows.
Driven to a fool's paradise.
But it's my turn to drive.
Driven to the margin of error.
Driven to the edge of control.
Driven to the margin of terror.
Driven to the edge of a deep, dark hole.
Driven day and night in circles.
Spinning like a whirlwind of leaves.
Stealing in and out back alleys.
Driven to another den of thieves.
But it's my turn to drive.
Driven in - Driven to the edge.
Driven out - On the thin end of the wedge.
Driven off - By things I've never seen.
Driven on - By the road to somewhere I've never been.
It's my turn to drive.
The road unwinds towards me.
What was there is gone.
The road unwinds before me.
And I go riding on.
Half The World.
Half the world hates.
What half the world does every day.
Half the world waits.
While half gets on with it anyway.
Half the world lives.
Half the world makes.
Half the world gives.
While the other half takes.
Half the world is.
Half the world was.
Half the world thinks.
While the other half does.
Half the world talks.
With half a mind on what they say.
Half the world walks.
With half a mind to run away.
Half the world lies.
Half the world learns.
Half the world flies.
As half the world turns.
Half the world cries.
Half the world laughs.
Half the world tries.
To be the other half.
Half of us divided.
Like a torn-up photograph.
Half of us are trying.
To reach the other half.
Half the world cares.
While half the world is wasting the day.
Half the world shares.
While half the world is stealing away.
The Color Of Right.
I don't have an explanation.
For another lonely night.
I just feel this sense of mission.
And the sense of what is right.
Take it easy on me now -.
I'd be there if I could.
I'm so full of what is right.
I can't see what is good.
It's a hopeless situation.
Lie awake for half the night.
You're not sure what's going on here.
But you're sure it isn't right.
Make it easy on yourself.
There's nothing more you can do.
You're so full of what is right.
You can't see what is true.
A quality of justice.
A quantity of light.
A particle of mercy.
Makes the color of right.
Gravity and distance.
Change the passage of light.
Gravity and distance.
Change the color of right.
Time And Motion.
Time and motion.
Wind and sun and rain.
Days connect like boxcars in a train.
Fill them up with precious cargo.
Squeeze in all that you can find.
Spontaneous elation.
And the long-enduring kind.
Time and motion.
Flesh and blood and fire.
Lives connect in webs of gold and razor wire.
Spin a thread of precious contact.
Squeeze in all that you can find.
Spontaneous relations.
And the long-enduring kind.
The mighty ocean.
Dances with the moon.
The silent forest.
Echoes with the loon.
Time and motion.
Live and love and dream.
Eyes connect like interstellar beams.
Superman in Supernature.
Needs all the comfort he can find.
Spontaneous emotion.
And the long enduring kind.
Totem.
I've got twelve disciples and a Buddha smile.
The Garden of Allah, Viking Valhalla.
A miracle once in a while.
I've got a pantheon of animals in a pagan soul.
Vishnu and Gaia - Aztec and Maya.
Dance around my totem pole.
I believe in what I see.
I believe in what I hear.
I believe that what I'm feeling.
Changes how the world appears.
Angels and demons dancing in my head.
Lunatics and monsters underneath my bed.
Media messiahs preying on my fears.
Pop culture prophets playing in my ears.
I've got celestial mechanics.
To synchronize my stars.
Seasonal migrations - daily variations.
World of the unlikely and bizarre.
I've got idols and icons, unspoken holy vows.
Thoughts to keep well-hidden -.
Sacred and forbidden.
Free to browse among the holy cows.
That's why I believe.
Angels and demons inside of me.
Saviors and Satans all around me.
Sweet chariot, swing low, coming for me.
Dog Years.
In a dog's life.
A year is really more like seven.
And all too soon a canine.
Will be chasing cars in doggie heaven.
It seems to me.
As we make our own few circles 'round the sun.
We get it backwards.
And our seven years go by like one.
Dog years - It's the season of the itch.
Dog years - With every scratch it reappears.
In the dog days.
People look to Sirius.
Dogs cry for the moon.
But those connections are mysterious.
It seems to me.
While it's true that every dog will have his day.
When all the bones are buried.
There is barely time to go outside and play.
Dog years - It's the season of the itch.
Dog years - With every scratch it reappears.
Dog years - For every sad son of a bitch.
Dog years - With his tail between his ears.
I'd rather be a tortoise from Galapagos.
Or a span of geological time.
Than be living in these dog years.
In a dog's brain.
A constant buzz of low-level static.
One sniff at the hydrant.
And the answer is automatic.
It seems to me.
As well make our own few circles 'round the block.
We've lost our senses.
For the higher-level static of talk.
Virtuality.
Like a shipwrecked mariner adrift on an unknown sea.
Clinging to the wreckage of the lost ship Fantasy.
I'm a castaway, stranded in a desolate land.
I can see the footprints in the virtual sand.
Net boy, net girl.
Send your signal 'round the world.
Let your fingers walk and talk.
And set you free.
Net boy, net girl.
Send your impulse 'round the world.
Put your message in a modem.
And throw it in the Cyber Sea.
Astronauts in the weightlessness of pixellated space.
Exchange graffiti with a disembodied race.
I can save the universe in a grain of sand.
I can hold the future in my virtual hand.
Let's dance tonight.
To a virtual song.
Press this key.
And you can play along.
Let's fly tonight.
On our virtual wings.
Press this key.
To see amazing things.
Like a pair of vagabonds who wave between two passing trains.
Or the glimpse of a woman's smile through a window in the rain.
I can smell her perfume, I can taste her lips.
I can feel the voltage from her fingertips.
Net boy, net girl.
Send your heartbeat round the world.
Resist.
I can learn to resist.
Anything but temptation.
I can learn to co-exist.
With anything but pain.
I can learn to compromise.
Anything but my desires.
I can learn to get along.
With all the things I can't explain.
I can learn to resist.
Anything but frustration.
I can learn to persist.
With anything but aiming low.
I can learn to close my eyes.
To anything but injustice.
I can learn to get along.
With all the things I don't know.
You can surrender.
Without a prayer.
But never really pray.
Pray without surrender.
You can fight.
Without ever winning.
But never ever win.
Without a fight.
Limbo.
Whatever happened to my Transylvania twist?.
Carve Away The Stone.
You can roll that stone.
To the top of the hill.
Drag your ball and chain.
Behind you.
You can carry that weight.
With an iron will.
Or let the pain remain.
Behind you.
Chip away the stone.
(Sisyphus).
Chip away the stone.
Make the burden lighter.
If you must roll that rock alone.
You can drive those wheels.
To the end of the road.
You will still find the past right.
Behind you.
Try to deny.
The weight of the load.
Try to put the sins of the past night.
Behind you.
Carve away the stone.
(Sisyhpus).
Carve away the stone.
Make a graven image.
With some features of your own.
You call roll the stone.
To the top of the hill.
You can carry that weight.
With an iron will.
You can drive those wheels.
To the end of the road.
You can try to deny.
The weight of the load.
Roll away the stone.
(Sisyhpus).
Roll away the stone.
If you could just move yours.
I could get working on my own.
One Little Victory.
A certain measure of innocence.
Willing to appear naive.
A certain degree of imagination.
A measure of make-believe.
A certain degree of surrender.
To the forces of light and heat.
A shot of satisfaction.
In a willingness to risk defeat.
Celebrate the moment.
As it turns into one more.
Another chance at victory.
Another chance to score.
The measure of the moment.
Is a difference of degree.
Just one little victory.
A spirit breaking free.
One little victory.
The greatest act can be.
One little victory.
A certain measure of righteousness.
A certain amount of force.
A certain degree of determination.
Daring on a different course.
A certain amount of resistance.
To the forces of the light and love.
A certain measure of tolerance.
A willingness to rise above.
Ceiling Unlimited.
It's not the heat.
It's the inhumanity.
Plugged into the sweat of a summer street.
Machine gun images pass.
Like malice through the looking glass.
The slackjaw gaze.
Of true profanity.
Feels more like surrender than defeat.
If culture is the curse of the thinking class.
If culture is the curse of the thinking class.
ceiling unlimited.
world so wide.
turn and turn again.
feeling unlimited.
still unsatisfied.
changes never end.
The vacant laugh.
Of true insanity.
Dressed up in the mask of Tragedy.
Programmed for the guts and glands.
Of idle minds and idle hands.
I rest my case -.
Or at least my vanity.
Dressed up in the mask of Comedy.
If laughter is a straw for a drowning man.
If laughter is a straw for a drowning man.
ceiling unlimited.
windows open wide.
look and look again.
feeling unlimited.
eyes on the prize.
changes never end.
winding like an ancient river.
the time is now again.
hope is like an endless river.
the time is now again.
Ghost Rider.
Pack up all those phantoms.
Shoulder that invisible load.
Keep on riding north and west.
Haunting that wilderness road.
Like a ghost rider.
Carry all those phantoms.
Through bitter wind and stormy skies.
From the desert to the mountain.
From the lowest low to the highest high.
Like a ghost rider.
Keep on riding North and West.
Then circle South and East.
Show me beauty, but there is no peace.
For the ghost rider.
Shadows on the road behind.
Shadows on the road ahead.
Nothing can stop you now.
There's a shadow on the road behind.
There's a shadow on the road ahead.
Nothing can stop you now.
Sunrise in the mirror.
Lightens that invisible load.
Riding on a nameless quest.
Haunting that wilderness road.
Like a ghost rider.
Just an escape artist.
Racing against the night.
A wandering hermit.
Racing toward the light.
From the White Sands.
To the Canyonlands.
To the redwood stands.
To the Barren Lands.
Sunrise on the road behind.
Sunset on the road ahead.
There's nothing to stop you now.
Nothing can stop you now.
Peaceable Kingdom.
A wave toward the clearing the sky.
All this time we're talking and sharing our Rational View.
A billion other voices are spreading other news.
All this time we're living and trying to understand.
Why a billion other choices are making their demands.
Talk of a Peaceable Kingdom.
Talk of a time without fear.
The ones we wish would listen.
Are never going to hear.
Justice against The Hanged Man.
Knight of Wands against the hour.
Swords against the kingdom.
Time against The Tower.
All this time we're shuffling and laying out all our cards.
While a billion other dealers are slipping past our guards.
All this time we're hoping and praying we all might learn.
While a billion other teachers are teaching them how to burn.
Dream of a Peaceable Kingdom.
Dream of a time without war.
The ones we wish would hear us.
Have heard it all before.
A wave toward the clearing sky.
A wave toward the clearing sky.
The Hermit against The Lovers.
Or the Devil against the Fool.
Swords against the kingdom.
The Wheel against the rules.
All this time we're burning like bonfires in the dark.
A billion other blazes are shooting off their sparks.
Every spark a drifting ember of desire.
To fall upon the earth and spark another fire.
A homeward angel on the fly.
A wave toward the clearing sky.
Stars Look Down.
Like the fly on the wheel, who says.
"What a lot of dust we're raising".
Are you under the illusion.
That you're part of this scheme?.
Seems like a lifetime ago.
You could look with pride.
On your world of dreams.
What is the meaning of this?.
And the stars look down.
What are you trying to do?.
And the stars look down.
Was it something I said.
And the stars look down.
Like the rat in a maze who says,.
"Watch me choose my own direction".
Are you under the illusion.
The path is winding your way?.
Are you surprised by confusion.
When it leads you astray?.
Have you lived a lifetime today -.
Or do you feel like you just got carried away?.
What is the meaning of this?.
And the stars look down.
What are you trying to do?.
And the stars look down.
Was it something I said?.
And the stars look down.
Something you'd like me to do?.
And the stars look down.
The stars look down.
How It Is.
Here's a little trap.
That sometimes catches everyone.
When today's as far as we can see.
Faith in bright tomorrows.
giving way to resignation.
That's how it is - how it's going to be.
It's such a cloudy day.
Seems we'll never see the sun.
Or feel the day has possibilities.
Frozen in the moment -.
the lack of imagination.
Between how it is and how it ought to be.
Here's a little trap.
That sometimes trips up everyone.
When we tire of our own company.
Sometimes we're the last to see beyond the day's frustrations.
That's how it is - how it's going to be.
It's such a cloudy day.
Seems we'll never see the sun.
I feel the day is all uncertainty.
Burning in the moment - trapped by the desperation.
Between how it is and how it ought to be.
Foot upon the stair.
Shoulder to the wheel.
You can't tell yourself not to care.
You can't tell yourself how to feel.
That's how it is.
Another cloudy day.
Vapor Trail.
Stratospheric traces of our transitory flight.
Trails of condensation held.
in narrow paths of white.
The sun is turning black.
The world is turning gray.
All the stars fade from the night.
The oceans drain away.
Horizon to Horizon.
memory written on the wind.
Fading away, like an hourglass, grain by grain.
Swept away like voices in a hurricane.
In a vapor trail.
Atmospheric phases make the transitory last.
Vaporize the memories that freeze the fading past.
Silence all the songbirds.
Stilled by the killing frost.
Forests burn to ashes.
Everything is lost.
Washed away like footprints in the rain.
In a vapor trail.
Secret Touch.
The way out.
Is the way in.
The way out.
Is the way in....
Out of touch.
With the weather and the wind direction.
With the sunrise.
And the phases of the moon.
Out of touch.
With life in the land of the loving.
With the living night.
And the darkness at high noon.
You can never break the chain.
There is never love without pain.
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart.
Out of sync.
With the rhythm of my own reactions.
With the things that last.
And the things that come apart.
Out of sync.
With love in the land of the living.
A gentle hand, a secret touch on the heart.
A healing hand, a secret touch on the heart.
There is never love without pain.
Life is a power that remains.
Earthshine.
On certain nights.
When the angles are right.
And the moon is a slender crescent.
Its circle shows.
In a ghostly glow.
Of earthly luminescence.
Earthshine.
A beacon in the night.
I can raise my eyes to.
Earthshine.
Earthshine.
A jewel out of reach.
Form a dream to rise to.
Earthshine.
Floating high.
In the evening sky.
I see my faint reflection.
Pale facsimile.
Like what others see.
When they look in my direction.
Earthshine.
Stretching out your hand.
Full of starlit diamonds.
Earthshine.
Reflected light.
To another's sight.
And the moon tells a lover's story.
My borrowed face.
And my third-hand grace.
Only reflect your glory.
You're still out of reach.
Form a dream to rise to.
Earthshine.
Sweet Miracle.
I wasn't walking on water.
I was standing on a reef.
When the tide came in.
Swept beneath the surface.
Lost without a trace.
No hope at all.
No hope at all.
Oh - sweet miracle.
Oh - sweet miracle.
Of life.
I wasn't walking with angels.
I was talking to myself.
Rising up to the surface.
Raging against the night.
Starless night.
Oh - sweet miracle.
Love's sweet miracle.
Of life.
Oh salvation.
Oh salvation.
I wasn't praying for magic.
I was hiding in plain sight.
Rising up from the surface.
To fly into the light.
Nocturne.
Did I have a dream?.
Or did the dream have me?.
Set off on a night-sea journey.
Without memory or desire.
Drifting through lost latitudes.
With no compass and no chart.
Flying through hallucination.
Distant voices, signals fire.
Lighting up my unconscious.
And the secret places of the heart.
Dream - Temporary madness.
Dream - A voice in the wilderness.
Dream - Unconscious revelations.
The morning says, the answer is yes.
Floating through a darkened mirror.
Deep reflections in disguise.
Soaring through lost altitudes.
Without wonder, without fear.
Symbols on a field of visions.
Behind the curtain of sleeping eyes.
On the instant of waking.
Another world of dreams appears.
Dream - A walk in the wilderness.
Dream - Unconscious recreation.
The morning says, the answer is yes.
Freeze.
The city crouches, steaming.
In the early morning half-light.
The sun is still a rumor.
And the night is still a threat.
Slipping through the dark streets.
And the echoes and the shadows.
Something stirs behind me.
And my palms begin to sweat.
Sometimes I freeze - until the light comes.
Sometimes I fly - into the night.
Sometimes I fight - against the darkness.
Sometimes I'm wrong - sometimes I'm right.
Coiled for the spring.
Or caught like a creature in the headlights.
Into a desperate panic.
Or a tempest of blind fury.
Like a cornered beast.
Or a conquering hero.
The menace threatens, closing.
And I'm frozen in the shadows.
I'm not prepared to run away.
And I'm not prepared to fight.
I can't stand to reason.
Or surrender to a reflex.
I will trust my instincts.
Or surrender to my fright.
Sometimes we freeze - until the light comes.
Sometimes we're wrong - and sometimes we're right.
Sometimes we fight - against the darkness.
Sometimes we fly - into the night.
Blood running cold.
Mind going down into a dark night.
Of a desperate panic.
Or a tempest of blind fury.
Like a cornered beast.
Or a conquering hero.
Sometimes I freeze.
Sometimes I fight.
Sometimes I fly.
Into the night.
Out of the Cradle.
It's not a place.
It's a yearning.
It's not a race.
It's a journey.
It's not an act.
It's attraction.
It's not a style.
It's an action.
It's a dream for the waking.
It's a flower touched by flame.
It's a gift for the giving.
It's a power with a hundred names.
Surge of energy, spark of inspiration.
The breath of love is electricity.
Maybe Time is bird in flight.
Endlessly mocking.
Here we come out of the cradle.
Endlessly rocking.
Endlessly rocking.
It's a hand.
That rocks the cradle.
It's a motion.
That swings the sky.
It's method on the edge of madness.
It's a balance on the edge of a knife.
It's a smile on the edge of sadness.
It's a dance on the edge of life.
Endlessly r o c k i n g.
Far Cry.
Pariah dogs and wandering madmen.
Barking at strangers and speaking in tongues.
The ebb and flow of tidal fortune.
Electrical changes are charging up the young.
It's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit.
It's a far cry from the way we thought we'd share it.
You can almost feel the current flowing.
You can almost see the circuits blowing.
One day I feel I'm on top of the world.
And the next it's falling in on me.
I can get back on.
I can get back on.
One day I feel I'm ahead of the wheel,.
And the next it's rolling over me.
I can get back on.
I can get back on.
Whirlwind life of faith and betrayal.
Rise in anger, fall back, and repeat.
Slow degrees on the dark horizon.
Full moon rising lays silver at your feet.
It's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit.
It's a far cry from the way we thought we'd share it.
You can almost feel the current flowing.
You can almost see the circuits blowing.
One day I feel I'm on top of the world.
And the next it's falling in on me.
I can get back on.
I can get back on.
One day I feel I'm ahead of the wheel,.
And the next it's rolling over me.
I can get back on.
I can get back on.
It's a far cry from the world we thought we'd inherit.
You can almost see the circle growing.
You can almost feel the planet glowing.
One day I feel I'm on top of the world.
And the next it's falling in on me.
I can get back on.
I can get back on.
One day I feel I'm ahead of the wheel,.
And the next it's rolling over me.
I can get back on.
I can get back on.
One day I fly through a crack in the sky.
And the next it's falling in on me.
I can get back on.
I can get back on.
Armor and Sword.
The snakes and arrows a child is heir to.
Are enough to leave a thousand cuts.
We build our defenses, a place of safety.
And leave the darker places unexplored.
Sometimes the fortress is too strong.
Or the love is too weak.
What should have been our armor.
Becomes a sharp and angry sword.
Our better natures seek elevation.
A refuge for the coming night.
No one gets to their heaven without a fight.
We hold beliefs as a consolation.
A way to take us out of ourselves.
Meditation, or medication.
A comfort, or a promised reward.
Sometimes the spirit is too strong.
Or the flesh is too weak.
Sometimes the need is just too great.
For the solace we seek.
The suit of shining armor.
Becomes a keen and bloody sword.
No one gets to their heaven without a fight.
A refuge for the coming night.
A future of eternal light.
No one gets to their heaven without a fight.
Confused alarms of struggle and flight.
Blood is drained of color.
By the flashes of artillery light.
No one gets to their heaven without a fight.
The battle flags are flown.
At the feet of a god unknown.
No one gets to their heaven without a fight.
Sometimes the damage is too great.
Or the will is too weak.
What should have been our armor.
Becomes a sharp and burning sword.
Workin' Them Angels.
Driving away to the east, and into the past.
History receeds in my rear-view mirror.
Carried away on a wave of music down a desert road.
Memory humming at the heart of a factory town.
All my life.
I've been workin' them angels overtime.
Riding and driving and living.
So close to the edge.
Workin' them angels - Overtime.
Riding through the Range of Light to the wounded city.
Filling my spirit with the wildest wish to fly.
Taking the high road to the wounded city.
Memory strumming at the heart of a moving picture.
All this time.
I've been workin' them angels overtime.
Riding and driving and flying.
Just over the edge.
Workin' them angels - Overtime.
Driving down the razor's edge 'tween the past and the future.
Turn up the music and smile.
Get carried away on the songs and stories of vanished times.
Memory drumming at the heart of an English winter.
Memories beating at the heart of an African village.
The Larger Bowl.
If we're so much the same like I always hear.
Why such different fortunes and fates?.
Some of us live in a cloud of fear.
Some live behind iron gates.
Why such different fortunes and fates?.
Some are blessed and some are cursed.
Some live behind iron gates.
While others only see the worst.
Some are blessed and some are cursed.
The golden one or scarred from birth.
While others only see the worst.
Such a lot of pain on the earth.
The golden one or scarred from birth.
Some things can never be changed.
Such a lot of pain on this earth.
It's somehow so badly arranged.
Some things can never be changed.
Some reasons will never come clear.
It's somehow so badly arranged.
If we're so much the same like I always hear.
Some are blessed and some are cursed.
The golden one or scarred from birth.
While others only see the worst.
Such a lot of pain on the earth.
Spindrift.
As the waves crash in.
On the western shore.
The wind blows fierce from the east.
Wave tops torn into flying spindrift.
As the waves crash in.
On the western shore.
It makes me feel uneasy.
The spray that's torn away.
Is an image of the way I feel.
What am I supposed to say?.
Where are the words to answer you.
When you talk that way?.
As sun goes down.
On the western shore.
The wind blows hard from the east.
It whips the sand into a flying spindrift.
As the sun goes down.
On the western shore.
It makes me feel uneasy.
In the hot dry rasp of the devil winds.
Who cares what a fool believes.
What am I supposed to say?.
Where are the words to answer you.
When you talk that way?.
Words that fly against the wind and waves.
(A little closer to you).
Where is the wave that will carry me.
A little closer to you?.
What am I suppose to do?.
Where are the words that will make you see.
What I believe is true?.
The Way the Wind Blows.
Now it's come to this.
It's like we're back in the Dark Ages.
From the Middle East to the Middle West.
It's a world of superstition.
Now it's come to this.
Wide-eyed armies of the faithful.
From the Middle East to the Middle West.
Pray, and pass the ammunition.
So many people think that way.
You gotta watch what you say.
To them and them, and others too.
Who don't seem to see to things the way you do.
We can only grow the way the wind blows.
on a bare and weathered shore.
We can only bow to the here and now.
In our elemental war.
We can only go the way the wind blows.
We can only bow to the here and now.
Or be broken down blow by blow.
Now it's come to this.
Hollow speeches of mass deception.
From the Middle East to the Middle West.
Like crusaders in a holy alliance.
Now it's come to this.
Like we're back in the dark ages.
From the Middle East to the Middle West.
It's a plague that resists our science.
It seems to leave them partly blind.
And they leave no child behind.
While evil spirits haunt their sleep.
While shepherds bless and count their sheep.
Like the solitary pine.
On a bare wind blasted shore.
We can only grow the way the wind blows.
Faithless.
I've got my own moral compass to steer by.
A guiding star beats a spirit in the sky.
And all the preaching voices -.
Empty vessels ring so loud.
As they move among the crowd.
Fools and thieves are well disguised.
In the temple and market place.
Like a stone in the river.
Against the floods of spring.
I will quietly resist.
Like the willows in the wind.
Or the cliffs along the ocean.
I will quietly resist.
I don't have faith in faith.
I don't believe in belief.
You can call me faithless.
I still cling to hope.
And I believe in love.
And that's faith enough for me.
I've got my own spirit level for balance.
To tell if my choice is leaning up or down.
And all the shouting voices.
Try to throw me off my course.
Some by sermon, some by force.
Fools and thieves are dangerous.
In the temple and market place.
Like a forest bows to winter.
Beneath the deep white silence.
I will quietly resist.
Like a flower in the desert.
That only blooms at night.
I will quietly resist.
Bravest Face.
Though we might have precious little.
It's still precious.
I like that song about this wonderful world.
It's got a sunny point of view.
And sometimes I feel it's true.
At least for a few of us.
I like that world, it makes a wonderful song.
But there's a darker point of view.
But sadly just as true.
For so many among us.
Though we might have precious little.
It's still precious.
In the sweetest child there's a vicious streak.
In the strongest man there's a child so weak.
In the whole wide world there's no magic place.
So you might as well rise put on your bravest face.
I like that show where they solve all the murders.
An heroic point of view.
It's got justice and vengeance too.
At least so the story goes.
I like that story, makes a satisfying case.
But there's a messy point of view.
That's sadly just as true.
For so many among us.
In softest voice there's an acid tongue.
In the oldest eyes there's a soul so young.
In the shakiest will there's a core of steel.
On the smoothest ride there's a squeaky wheel.
Though we might have precious little.
It's still precious.
Good News First.
The best we can agree on.
Is it could have been worse.
What happen to your old.
Benevolent universe?.
You know the one with stars.
That revolve around you.
Beaming down full of promises.
To bring good news.
You used to feel that way.
The saddest words you could ever say.
But I know you'll remember that day.
And the most beautiful words I could ever say.
The worst thing about it all.
Is that you've never been right.
And I'm still not really sure.
What started that fight.
But I still get this feeling.
There's more trouble ahead.
So never mind the bad news.
Let's have the good news instead.
Some would say they never fear a thing.
Well I do.
And I'm afraid enough for both of us.
For me and you.
Time, if nothing else, will do it's worst.
So do me that favor.
And tell me the good news first.
We Hold On.
How many times.
Do we tire of all the little battles.
Threaten to call it quits.
Tempted to cut and run.
How many times.
Do we weather out the stormy evenings.
Long to slam the front door.
Drive away into the setting sun.
Keep going on till dawn.
How many times must another line be drawn.
We could be down and gone.
But we hold on.
How many times.
Do we chafe against the repetition.
Straining against a fate.
Measured out in coffee breaks.
How many times.
Do we swallow our ambition.
Long to give up the same old way.
Find another road to take.
Keep holding on so long.
'Cause there's a chance that we might not be so wrong.
We could be down and gone.
But we hold on.
How many times.
Do we wonder if it's even worth it.
Theres got to be some other way.
Way to get me through the day.
Keep going on till dawn.
How many times must another line be drawn.
We could be down and gone.
But we hold on.
Caravan.
IT SEEMS LIKE A LIFETIME AGO - which of course it was, all that and more. For a boy, life on the.
farm was idyllic, but for the young man I became, that very peace and predictability were stifling,.
unbearable. I had big dreams, and needed a big place to explore them: the whole wide world. Near our.
village of Barrel Arbor, the steamliners touched down and traveled on rails along the Winding Pinion.
River toward Crown City. Watching them pass in the night, how I prayed to get away . . ..
In a world lit only by fire.
Long train of flares under piercing stars.
I stand watching the steamliners roll by.
The caravan thunders onward.
To the distant dream of the city.
The caravan carries me onward.
On my way at last.
On my way at last.
I can't stop thinking big.
I can't stop thinking big.
On a road lit only by fire.
Going where I want, instead of where I should.
I peer out at the passing shadows.
Carried through the night into the city.
Where a young man has a chance of making good.
A chance to break from the past.
The caravan thunders onward.
Stars winking through the canvas hood.
On my way at last.
In a world where I feel so small.
I can't stop thinking big.
BU2B.
WE WERE ALWAYS TAUGHT that we lived in "the best of all possible worlds." The Watchmaker ruled.
from Crown City through the Regulators; the alchemist-priests gave us coldfire for power and light,.
and everything was well ordered. We accepted our various individual fates as inevitable, for we had.
also been taught, "Whatever happens to us must be what we deserve, for it could not happen to us if we.
did not deserve it. None of it seemed right to me. . .".
I was brought up to believe.
The universe has a plan.
We are only human.
It's not ours to understand.
The universe has a plan.
All is for the best.
Some will be rewarded.
And the devil take the rest.
All is for the best.
Believe in what we're told.
Blind men in the market.
Buying what we're sold.
Believe in what we're told.
Until our final breath.
While our loving Watchmaker.
Loves us all to death.
In a world of cut and thrust.
I was always taught to trust.
In a world where all must fail.
Heaven's justice will prevail.
The joy and pain that we receive.
Each comes with its own cost.
The price of what we're winning.
Is the same as what we've lost.
Until our final breath.
The joy and pain that we receive.
Must be what we deserve.
I was brought up to believe.
Clockwork Angels.
THE PLACE I HAD MOST WANTED TO SEE - Chronos Square, at the heart of Crown City. I had seen.
many images of the city before, and Chronos Square, but nothing could convey its immensity - the.
heaven-reaching towers of the Cathedral of the Timekeepers, or the radiant glory of the Angels - Land,.
Sea, Sky, and Light - bathed in the brilliant glow of the floating globes..
High above the city square.
Globes of light float in mid-air.
Higher still, against the night.
Clockwork angels bathed in light.
You promise every treasure, to the foolish and the wise.
Goddesses of mystery, spirits in disguise.
Every pleasure, we bow and close our eyes.
Clockwork angels, promise every prize.
Clockwork angels, spread their arms and sing.
Synchronized and graceful, they move like living things.
Goddesses of Light, of Sea and Sky and Land.
Clockwork angels, the people raise their hands -- As if to fly.
All around the city square.
Power shimmers in the air.
People gazing up with love.
To those angels high above.
Celestial machinery - move through your commands.
Goddesses of mystery, so delicate and so grand.
Moved to worship, we bow and close our eyes.
Clockwork angels, promise every prize.
"Lean not upon your own understanding *.
Ignorance is well and truly blessed.
Trust in perfect love, and perfect planning.
Everything will turn out for the best".
Stars aglow like scattered sparks.
Span the sky in clockwork arcs.
Hint at more than we can see.
Spiritual machinery.
A foggy woodland road, a crowded village square, the busy streets of Crown City - a wandering pedlar.
travels the land, uttering the ageless call..
"What do you lack?".
The Anarchist.
WALKING AMONG THE PEOPLE - who are so content, so blind -- the Anarchist hears the pedlar's.
call, and sneers derisively. "What do I lack? Ah. . . vengeance?".
Will there be world enough and time for me to sing that song?.
A voice so silent for so long.
For all those years I had to get along, they told me I was wrong.
I never wanted to belong - I was so strong.
I lack their smiles and their diamonds; I lack their happiness and love.
I envy them for all those things, I never got my fair share of.
The lenses inside of me that paint the world black.
The pools of poison, the scarlet mist, that spill over into rage.
The things I've always been denied.
An early promise that somehow died.
A missing part of me that grows around me like a cage.
In all your science of the mind, seeking blind through flesh and bone.
Find the blood inside this stone.
What I know, I've never shown; what I feel, I've always known.
I plan my vengeance on my own - and I was always alone.
Oh - They tried to get me.
Oh - They'll never forget me.
Carnies.
I FOUND WORK WITH A TRAVELING CARNIVAL, and for the Midsummer Festival in Crown City,.
our games and rides were set up right in the middle of the Square, beneath the Angels. One night, amid.
the noise and confusion of the crowded midway, I saw, a man working with wires and wooden barrels..
He stood and turned - the Anarchist! - holding a clockwork detonator in his hand. I called out to warn.
the crowd, then suddenly he threw the device at me, and I caught it automatically - just as the people.
turned to look my way. I escaped, but in disgrace, and fled down the Winding Pinion River to the sea..
Under the gaze of the angels.
A spectacle like he's never seen.
Spinning lights and faces.
Demon music and gypsy queens.
The glint of iron wheels.
Bodies spin in a clockwork dance.
The smell of flint and steel.
A wheel of fate, a game of chance.
How I prayed just to get away.
To carry me anywhere.
Sometimes the angels punish us.
By answering our prayers.
A face of naked evil.
Turns the young boy's blood to ice.
Deadly confrontation.
Such a dangerous device.
Shout to warn the crowd.
Accusations ringing loud.
A ticking box, in the hand of the innocent.
The angry crowd moves toward him with bad intent.
Halo Effect.
I HAD FALLEN HELPLESSLY IN LOVE with one of the performers. She was so different from "the girl.
I left behind," and I was beginning to understand I had only pretended she was right for me. I pursued.
my beautiful acrobat obsessively until she let me be with her - then I suffered her rejection and.
contempt. Once again, I had created an ideal of the perfect soulmate, and tried to graft in onto her. It.
didn't fit. Such illusions have colored my whole life..
What did I see?.
Fool that I was.
A goddess, with wings on her heels.
All my illusions.
Projected on her.
The ideal, that I wanted to see.
What did I know?.
Fool that I was.
Little by little, I learned.
My friends were dismayed.
To see my betrayed.
But they knew they could never tell me.
What did I care?.
Fool that I was.
Little by little, I burned.
Maybe sometimes.
There might be a flaw.
But how pretty the picture was back then.
What did I do?.
Fool that I was.
To profit from youthful mistakes?.
It's shameful to tell.
How often I fell.
In love with illusions again.
So shameful to tell.
Just how often I fell.
In love with illusions again.
A goddess with wings on her heels . . ..
Seven Cities Of Gold.
THE LEGEND HAD PASSED DOWN FOR GENERATIONS. Far across the Western Sea, where the.
steamliners could not fly, lay a wilderness land hiding seven cities of gold. I dared the crossing on one.
of the stout ships that followed the trade route to Poseidon, a tough port city. I worked there for a while.
on the steamliners that served the alchemy mines, then eventually set out into the Redrock Desert. The.
stones were sculpted into unearthly monuments, and the country grew cold as I traveled north in.
search of the most famous City of Gold: Cibola. Its name had sounded in my dreams since childhood..
A man can lose his past, in a country like this.
Wandering aimless.
Parched and nameless.
A Man could lose his way, in a country like this.
Canyons and cactus.
Endless and trackless.
Searching through grim eternity.
Sculptured by a prehistoric sea.
Seven Cities of Gold.
Stories that fired my imagination.
Seven Cities of Gold.
A splendid mirage in this desolation.
Seven Cities of Gold.
Glowing in my dreams, like hallucinations.
Glitter in the sun like a revelation.
Distant as a comet or a constellation.
A man can lose himself, in a country like this.
Rewrite the story.
Recapture the glory.
A man could lose his life, in a country like this.
Sunblind and friendless.
Frozen and endless.
The nights grow longer, the farther I go.
Wake to aching cold, and a deep Sahara of snow.
That gleam in the distance could be heaven's gate.
A long-awaited treasure at the end of my cruel fate.
The Wreckers.
NARROWLY ESCAPING A FROZEN DEATH IN THAT DESERT, I made my way back to Poseidon,.
and found a berth on a homeward ship. Caught in a terrible storm, we seemed to find salvation in an.
unexpected signal light. Steering toward it, we soon learned it was false - placed by the denizens to.
lure ships to their doom on the jagged reefs. They plundered the cargos and abandoned the crews and.
passengers to the icy waves. I was the only survivor..
The breakers roar on an unseen shore.
In the teeth of a hurricane.
We struggle in vain.
A hellish night - a ghostly light.
Appears trough the driving rain.
Salvation in a human chain.
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary.
Of a miracle too good to be true.
All I know is that sometimes the truth is contrary.
Everything in life you thought you knew.
All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary.
'Cause sometimes the target is you.
Driven aground, with that awful sound.
Drowned by the cheer from ashore.
We wonder what for.
The people swarm through the darkling storm.
Gather everything the can score.
'Til their backs won't bear any more.
The breakers roar on an unseen shore.
In the teeth of an icy grave.
The human chain leaves a bloody stain.
Washed away in the pounding waves.
All I know is that memory can be too much to carry.
Striking down like a bolt from the blue.
Headlong Flight.
THINKING BACK OVER MY LIFE, AND TELLING STORIES ABOUT MY "GREAT ADVENTURES".
-- they didn't always feel that grand at the time. But on balance, I wouldn't change anything. In the.
words of one of our great alchemists, Friedrich Gruber, "I wish I could do it all again.".
All the journeys Some nights were bright.
Of this great adventure I wish that I could live it all again.
It didn't always feel that way.
I wouldn't trade them I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels.
Because I made them Steered the airship right across the stars.
The best I could I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel.
And that's enough to say Oh, I wish that I could live it all again.
Some days were dark The days were dark.
I wish that I could live it all again And the nights were bright.
Some nights were bright Hey now, I would never trade tomorrow for today.
I wish that I could live it all again Yeah....
All the highlights of that headlong flight All the highlights of that headlong flight.
Holding on with all my might Holding on with all my might.
To what I felt back then Some days were dark.
I wish that I could live it all again I wish that I could live it all again.
Some nights were bright.
I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels I wish that I could live it all again.
Steered the airship right across the stars.
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels.
Oh, I wish that I could live it all again Steered the airship right across the stars.
I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel.
All the treasures Oh, I wish that I could live it all again.
The gold and glory.
It didn't always feel that way I have stoked the fire on the big steel wheels.
I don't regret it Steered the airship right across the stars.
I'll never forget it I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to.
I wouldn't trade tomorrow for today steal.
Oh, I wish that I could.
Some days were dark Oh, I wish that I could live it all again.
I wish that I could live it all again.
The ever-wandering pedlar..
"What do you lack?".
BU2B2.
THOSE FATEFUL WORDS. "What do you lack?" spark an inner monologue about all that I have lost..
No more boundless optimism, no more faith in greater powers, too much pain, too much grief, and too.
much disillusion. Despite all that, I realize the great irony that although I now believe only in the.
exchange of love, even that little faith follows the childhood reflex that "I was brought up to believe.".
I was brought up to believe.
Belief has failed me now.
The bright glow of optimism.
Abandoned me somehow.
Belief has failed me now.
Life goes from bad to worse.
No philosophy consoles me.
In a clockwork universe.
Life goes from bad to worse.
I still choose to live.
Find a measure of love and laughter.
And another measure to give.
I still choose to live.
And give, even while I grieve.
Though the balance tilts against me.
I was brought up to believe.
Wish Them Well.
VICTIMIZED, BEREAVED, AND DISAPPOINTED, SEEMINGLY AT EVERY TURN, I still resist.
feeling defeated, or cynical. I have come to believe that anger and grudges are burning embers in the.
heart not worth carrying through life. The best response to those who wound me is to get away from.
them - and wish them well..
All that you can do is wish them well.
All that you can do is wish them well.
Spirits turned bitter by the poison of envy.
Always angry and dissatisfied.
Even the lost ones, the frightened and mean ones.
Even the ones with a devil inside.
Thank your stars you're not that way.
Turn your back and walk away.
Don't even pause and ask them why.
Turn around and say goodbye.
People who judge without a measure of mercy.
All the victims who will never learn.
Even the lost ones, you can only give up on.
Even the ones who make you burn.
The ones who've done you wrong.
The ones who pretended to be so strong.
The grudges you've held for so long.
It's not worth singing that same sad song.
Even though you're going through hell.
Just keep on going.
Let the demons dwell.
Just wish them well.
The Garden.
LONG AGO I READ A STORY FROM ANOTHER TIMELINE about a character named Candide. He.
also survived a harrowing series of misadventures and tragedies, then settled on a farm near.
Constantinople. Listening to a philosophical rant, Candide replied, "That is all very well, but now we.
must tend our garden." I have now arrived at that point in my own story. There is a metaphorical.
garden in the acts and attitudes of a person's life, and the treasures of that garden are love and respect.
I have come to realize that the gathering of love and respect - from others and for myself - has been the.
real quest of my life. "Now we must tend our garden.".
In this one of many possible worlds, all for the best, or some bizarre test?.
It is what it is - and whatever.
Time is still the infinite jest.
The arrow files when you dream, the hours tick away - the cells tick away.
The Watchmaker keeps to his schemes.
The hours tick away - they tick away.
The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect.
So hard to earn, so easily burned.
In the fullness of time.
A garden to nurture and protect.
In the rise and the set of the sun.
'Til the stars go spinning - spinning 'round the night.
It is what it is - and forever.
Each moment a memory in flight.
The arrow flies while you breathe, the hours tick away - the cells tick away.
The Watchmaker has time up his sleeve.
The hours tick away - they tick away.
The treasure of a life is a measure of love and respect.
The way you live, the gifts that you give.
In the fullness of time.
It's the only return that you expect.
The future disappears into memory.
With only a moment between.
Forever dwells in that moment.
Hope is what remains to be seen.
